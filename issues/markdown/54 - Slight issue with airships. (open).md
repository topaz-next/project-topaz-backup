If you set your character to auto-run against the invisible "no airship here" wall, they will board the entrance platform to the airship when it arrives, however the airship will take off without them, leaving them suspended above the water. 

They will still be able to run where the airship floor would have been, and they will even be able to see a floating airship lounge above the water. 

I think the hitbox for being on the airship (however that is handled) needs to be extended to the little platform area attached to the airship.
