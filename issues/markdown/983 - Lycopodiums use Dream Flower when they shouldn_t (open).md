**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Lycopodiums are currently coded to use the typical Mandragora skill list. This includes Dream Flower, which they apparently should never use. I'm not certain what their full skill list should be, so I'm not submitting a PR as of this time. If Dream Flower is removed, it makes the Rolanberry Fields (S) Lycopodiums an attractive (S) camp prior to the East Ronfaure (S) colibri camp.

>  Another big draw to Lycopodiums is that Lycopodiums don't use Dream Flower.

I just created a new list on Era removing Dream Flower. If others are content with that, more than happy to submit a quick PR for it.

Do you know if all of the other TP moves are the same?

@TeoTwawki Are you saying they use Petal Pirouette? FFXIclopedia definitely began it's decline post-WotG due to politics, so it's not 100% clear from just wikis what their skill list might be. I don't see any videos or captures for it either.

In the case of some NM Lycos its the only move they get at all. I was pretty sure the normies get it in place of dream flower...We're going to need testers to go feed one tp because ffxiclopedia is claiming only the NMs have it (and bg doesn't specify at all).

In any case the fix for dream flower is: make a new list that omits dream flower. give that to lyco pools. done.
