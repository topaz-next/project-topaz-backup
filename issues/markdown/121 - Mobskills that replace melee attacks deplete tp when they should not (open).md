This must be a new thing. As of a few months ago it was functioning properly wherein the air-based attacks would neither give nor deplete TP.

Just have to flag the skill as a special.

Which flag? github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/blob/master/sql/mob_skills.sqlDarkstar Issue L1085 looking at the aerial attacks they all have the flag value 16 already.

that's not really the solution anyways - there are some mobs that use regular TP moves as attacks (megamaw mike, for example)

setflag in _skill list table_ instead of _skills table_, and then make the flag prevent the tp change? Mikey would have his "not flagged" if he's supposed to gain tp from using them. Should probably rename the flag, since the flag itself isn't what makes them be a melee substitute anymore.

..Probably be issues with having to basically set the flag per mob then though, I am guessing. Maybe tp gain itself should be in script instead of core.

Couldn't you check to see if the mobskill is contained in that mob's auto attack thing? And if it is, don't deplete tp?

No guarantee that's where it came from. Just need something from the
OnAttack to signify it's a melee attack

There are mobs that can use a mobskill as a melee attack and as an actual mobskill at the same time? Huh.

Could be. Why restrict it so if we don't need to?

Stupid question, but mob 2hrs shouldn't be consuming tp either, right? It looks like forced called 2hrs do.

I don't believe mob 2hrs consume TP no.
