As title says. Relevant info from the [wiki page](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Paralyze_(Status_Effect)):

> The results of a paralyzed action vary on the type of action. A paralyzed spell will not cast but also not consume any MP (or Ninja Tools for Ninjutsu), and may be attempted again seconds later without having to wait for the spell's full recast time. **A paralyzed job ability will not take effect but it will still be "consumed", requiring the player to have to wait the full recast time of the JA to try using it again (the sole exception is the Two Hour Ability, which can be paralyzed but can be attempted again a few seconds later, like spells).** A paralyzed item will not take effect but will still be consumed, resulting in a lost item or Enchantment charge. Caution is advised when using any items while in combat against a foe capable of paralyzing you.
> 
> Weapon Skills, monster TP abilities, and avatar Blood Pact abilities are not affected by paralysis (although the Job Abilities "Blood Pact: Rage" and "Blood Pact: Ward" themselves may be paralyzed).

that wiki page is outdated. paralyze isn't the same as it used to be. I just want to point this out because item loss was removed. players should still be hit with cooldowns however, so there is something to fix here.
