_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1407_

----

Too much changed to go into detail here. I have summarized changes in each commit and my code is packed full of comments and links to references and research.

Super short summary: 
Updated battleutils and summon.lua with equations for pDIF, fSTR, Hit Rate, Level Correction.
I have updated the base weapon computation for avatars.
I have updated how crit rate from dex works.
Level correction is not computed for newer zones/content since the release of SoA.
Some minor bug fixes.

Note: I have not updated the BP damage equations and plan to tackle those in the future, likely one avatar per PR or maybe even one BP per PR.

Note: I have not added the Damage Limit+ trait or "Physical Damage +%" to the computations as I do not believe the project supports them yet. I have noted how they were and where they need to be added once they are implemented.

> And maybe an excuse to introduce a new rule:
In lua you're leaving a space after starting a comment: -- Comment
Can you do the same with C++: // Comment instead of //Comment

new? that was always a rule. I know coz it was my rule before topaz happened. :stuck_out_tongue:

Sure, I'll fix these today üëç 
Just to be clear on the thread name: "General combat calculation improvements for Avatars"
This will impact players as well, I started with the summon.lua but then that drifted into the general combat equations for the melee hits.

Just realized I forgot to implement the request to give avatars crit att bonus from db and get rid of the hard coding. Will try to get that done in a day or two

Changed the crit bonus to a modifier and added the modifier logic to summon.lua as well

I have retested and confirmed I see no issues. As always, let me know if there's anything else üëç

We were talking about this PR yesterday; Avatars will eventually need a full rewrite, but this lays out a well-researched framework for when that happens üëç

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help regarding avatars or if there's anything you'd prefer to have prioritized. My next plan was to move onto blood pact equations including modifiers. I have been collecting some Pet: DEX+/STR+ gear for math stuff on retail.

I honestly know nothing about combat balancing and rely on the others for sanity checking, but if you continue testing things and documenting your sources, we'll have all of that available when someone "fixes" avatars üëç
