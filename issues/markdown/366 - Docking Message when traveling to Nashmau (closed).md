_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 366_

----

Added ID for message (as it's not part of CS)
When loading into the boat, it will store the Vanadiel hour and minute.
It will check the time it should be arriving depending on the boat schedule.
It will subtract the time the boat will dock and the time the char zoned in then use that as
a timer so the text shows to the player on the correct time.
Once this is approved I'll do the same thing to the other boats
Also removed semicolons

GitHub seems to be having some issues detecting that kain has pushed changes to his branch; we're troubleshooting.
