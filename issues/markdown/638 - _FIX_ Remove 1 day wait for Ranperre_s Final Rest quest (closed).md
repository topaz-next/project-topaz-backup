Hello, MarkWaldron. Thank you for your interest in Project Topaz!

Another Contributor had submitted a Pull Request which addresses the quest in question. That Pull Request was merged, and I have been informed by Staff that it would make the changes in this Pull Request redundant. Therefore I must unfortunately close this Pull Request.

Should you feel that this determination is in error, please do not be afraid to say so!

I apologize on behalf of the project, and hope that this does not discourage you from further contributions.
