I think that's a roaming problem? Don't think they are supposed to roam to
land but I could be wrong

I don't think they were roaming in that zone yet? I was roaming zone farming tissues, but not really watching to see if mobs were actually roaming, though.

They aren't supposed to, but even before the navmesh there were some that were under land. Of course, that applies only to ones that are idle underwater.
