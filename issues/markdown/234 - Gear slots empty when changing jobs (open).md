From what i recall when i played retail - when changing jobs, and the gear that I had on my character was usable on the class that I have changed to, it remained in the slot (for example, i have Kirin's Osode equipped on my NIN, changing to sam, that body armor would have persist on SAM, cause it's able to equip it). What i noticed in DS- all gear slots are emptied when changing jobs.

my recollection is it "Remembering" what gear I had equipped on the other job and if I still had it in the same inventory container, it'd be equipped still on changing job back.
