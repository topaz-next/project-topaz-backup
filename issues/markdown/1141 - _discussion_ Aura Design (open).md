_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1141_

----

I'm trying to get the ball rolling on integrating all of the GEO code, and the first step to that is getting aura handling into core. No content, just a single aura. This is a very heavy-weight mechanic which I don't want to populate with content until it's performant and working as well and as safely as we can get it.

Starting PR:
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1138

The areas in question:
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1138/files#diff-4fa3f9f67b44be17ddcfcbb83b337bfbR270
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1138/files#diff-0c15fa23f4c9823216f55fb835928c67R1517

The problem (in addition to what IBM mentioned) that I was going after in the next day or so - is that this first iteration targets anyone of the same allegiance to you, so it'll hit other parties. 

I'm just about to start work so I can't dig in now, but I'm forseeing a trip into "however curaga works" will yield me some answers.

From the PR:
ibm:
>allegiance.PLAYER is the wrong approach to the problem. Bubble types should be tagged as targeting aliies or enemies, and allegiance checks against potential targets done based on that.
>
> If this paradigm isn't corrected early, it will bite people in the ass the second they start trying to implement NMs with auras.

teo:
> Oops. Good catch tho, donâ€™t want to repeat the player/mob paradigm that is a problem with skill/ability use atm.

now find myself wondering if there are any retail mobs that use curaga, and if so do we even do that right.

This is looking like a good place for the fabled `reverse enmity container`
