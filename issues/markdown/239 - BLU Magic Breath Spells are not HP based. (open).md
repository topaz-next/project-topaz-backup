**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
All breath spells for BLU are using MND as a modifier for it's damage. This is incorrect. MND is used to determine the additional effect like silence, burn, frost, etc. The damage itself should be based on current HP. To reproduce just lower your current hp and use spell. Raise HP and use spell, spell damage is virtually the same. 

Different breath spells have different HP modifiers.
Heat Breath is 50% current HP
Frost Breath is 33% current HP
Flying Hip Press is 33% current HP
Hecatomb Wave is 25% current HP
Radiant Breath is 20% current HP
Magnetite Cloud is 16% current HP
Bad Breath is 12% current HP
Poison Breath is 10% current HP

I haven't really gone through the rest of the source to be able to tell if this is something that could be achieved by adding a `statMod` of `HP_BASED` but maybe that'd be a place to start?  The dmg formulas look like they might be a bit different for each spell but I'd think dsp has something to support the variants already.  For example one of the notes in heat breath reads: 

> Base damage is equal to players current HP divided by 2, but is subject to fractional resists.

I'm guessing other spells are also subject to fractional resists? (is that the same as an elemental resist? or is it more extreme?)

I believe the main problem with this is that the formulas for mob BLU breath spells aren't known. If they were to use the player formulas, they'd just one shot everyone with the spells.

While the resistance rates may not be specifically known, can they not be generalized to help make this ability slightly more accurate?
