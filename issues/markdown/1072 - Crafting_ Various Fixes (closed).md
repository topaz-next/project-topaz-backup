_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1072_

----

- Corrected Highest skill checked, so it cannot be the same skill we are currently leveling.
- Added skill down messages.
- Renamed a variable, to make its function more clear
- Changed 0.2+ skill ups level limit to 60 since we got confirmation from retail.
- Removed some magic numbers.

Also, thank you Kreidos for the Git help.

If ppl want me to make a new configuration just for it, I'll add it, no problem.

Just to be clear, skill ups over 0.1 can still happen is you configure the already existing skill up amount multiplier.

@zach2good 
I can add customization options in a later PR. This isn't the last crafting related PR I'm going to make anyway, there are still many changes left pending, wich will need customization options to switch between era and current retail.
I'd rather leave this PR as it is and merged whenever possible, becuse this is mainly a bugfix wich was affecting one player from canaria.
