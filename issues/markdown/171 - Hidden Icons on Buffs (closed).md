Hello. I'm unable to reproduce this issue on canary as of 03/19/2020, I tried to reproduce this while having a BRD and a SCH in the same PT and under Sublimation, all icons were displayed correctly (with both sets). Feel free to reopen an issue if you come across something new regarding this. Thank you.
