You can also do this by sending the packet directly, which is what various gear management plugins do.

IIRC you can also do this on retail via a cosmetic race-changing plugin to bypass the client-side restriction. Well, that was the case years ago. And doing that would probably get you reported to a GM. The question is, can it still be done on retail? If so, it's technically proper behaviour.

It can, SE hasn't fixed yet. I think we should anyway. Equipset allows more exploits than just race bypass.

Race data is already in the db, isn't it?

Doesn't look like it. I don't see it in item_armor.sql. 

I suppose this means that gender-locked gear can be equipped by the wrong gender via /equipset as well.

Different genders of the same race are technically different races - ie. Hume M and Hume F are different races from each other. It would probably be better to handle gender in the same way as races would be done.
