The script looks ok, what exactly is the problem? Did you confirm your sandy fame is >3 and the quest is available to you?

I recall fame NPCs + our related settings getting overhauled some time ago due to SE changing the fame rates to be 3x the oldschool values. if the server he's playing on has an outdated script that would explain it saying he's tier 9 when he's really much lower perfectly.

It's also possibly something got botched on 1 of them. I don't know if each and every fame NPC was tested and I know SE used more than 1 style of event params because we had one of the others borked for a week or two before it got fixed.

Could just be a bad param.
