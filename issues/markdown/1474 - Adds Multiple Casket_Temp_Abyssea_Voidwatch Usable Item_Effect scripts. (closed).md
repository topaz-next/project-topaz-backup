Notes on effects:

Ascetics Tonic/Gambir - +25/+50 MATT/MACC
A big Thank You to Nyu for confirming the Intension effect for MACC.

Bravers Drink - +15 to All Stats
https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Braver's%20Drink
Reference to Icons/Effects - https://youtu.be/JYT5a_pTA3o?t=20

Champions Tonic - +15 Haste / +3 Crit rate
Champions Drink/Gambir - +18 Haste / +5% Crit rate
Expected Haste effect to be Magic pool based on BG comment (18 and 15)
Critical Hit rate, no data available from community sources, conservative value of 5 (Drink/Gambir) 3 (Tonic)
Both BG and 'clopedia sources confirm Critical Hit Rate (as does the effect description), however, only BG has a reference to Haste value.

Gnostics Drink - Enmity -10
No community resources confirm this value, using SCH Animus Minuo as an analog.

Monarchs Drink - Regain +3 (30/1000 per tick) for 3 minutes.
https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Monarch's_Drink

Stalwart's Tonic/Gambir - ACC/RACC 50/100 ATTP/RATTP 25/50
A big Thank You to Nyu for confirming the effects apply ACC/RACC and ATTP/RATTP across two effects.

Berserker's Tonic/Drink - DA 50/100
Thanks to Nyu for confirming the MULTI_STRIKES effect and 1m duration.
https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Berserker%27s_Drink
No full data on DA rate, minus 'clopedia which has verification tags. Working on the expectation that this follows a good portion of the other items and follows the half potency values for the lesser item.

Dusty Scroll of Reraise - Reraise III, 10m duration.
