**Since all the SQL changes were moved into another PR, I'll re-work this PR into being:**
- Trust spell list loading
- Trust spell selection
- Trust recast tracking
- A little ground work for Trust magic bursting

**As always, I have inflated the scope of this PR because I hate myself, and this now includes:**
- The bones of the ibm's gambit system, a basic behaviour definition system for trusts

**Note:**

Until that goes in, this will be un-reviewable
