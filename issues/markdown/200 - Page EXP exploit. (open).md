**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
1) Have a high level char join a low level party. (can be as little as just 2 people.)
2) The high level char can use spikes and power level as long as they do not directly interact with the mob. (no Provoke or debuffs)
3) have both chars choose a exp book page that would be suitable for the lower level char. (Dunes, Qufim, Crawlers Nest, etc...)
4) Kill things with the lower level char. Neither person will get direct exp from the mobs, but they will get page credits. You can even put up ice spikes etc and just cure bomb the lower level char to pull hate and have the mob kill itself.
5) Enjoy exploiting you bad person you.

Hmmm thought I could just "dirty" the exp the same way we do if a high lv player directly attacks something and check that in `checkValorCredit()`..

But now I can't seem to find where thats being set in the first place. The only place I see it being set is in petutils, all other entries are turning it back off (true = can get exp, false = exp is "dirtry").
