----

When I log back in, pretty much every time in the last month or so, I'm in the /shutdown kneeling position. That could probably be an issue in itself.

Sometimes, my character does not stand back up on its own. If I leave it for 5+ seconds, the shutdown counter begins again.

Current rev: 6335399
Server: Classic
