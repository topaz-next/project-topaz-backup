**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** You can use addons and plugins to be notified the moment you start a craft if it's NQ/HQ/breakage/etc.  While crafting, you can use  homepoint,, or have someone cast Warp II or teleport you mid-craft if it's either going to break or NQ and you want HQ, etc.  This doesn't consume your materials and you potentially can just use the exact same mats.  The only thing it consumes is the crystal.

I swore this was fixed before by making the synth break on being zoned. Though, what happens on retail is you lose the materials and crystal as soon as the synth starts. This is what causes people losing their Lu Shang's rod on retail, trying to fix it on the boat and the boat ride ends mid synth.

Hozu I thought that too and started hunting through old commits looking for it. I also thought someone reported this same thing awhile back and it was determined this can't be happening. I can't find a commit or an older issue report now though. But I could swear I've seen it!

you mean the ingredients are lost when you start, and the finished product is awarded at synth completion?

Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's the case. It explains the loss of everything on zoning that retail has (unless they changed that sometime in the past 7 years or so).

that sounds pretty easy to implement, though i think in your inventory screen they are just greyed out

This fix may also fix the issue wherein items don't get lost on break, but instead stay greyed out in inventory.

the code currently treats zoning during syntheses as a standard break, with the normal chance to lose materials

is that wrong?

IIRC yes. I remember people being able to lose their broken lu shang's rod when they zone on the boat during the repair synth. All materials get lost.

Unless it was changed in the post-75 era it would be all materials + crystal removed on synth start, then add the finished product on synth completion.
