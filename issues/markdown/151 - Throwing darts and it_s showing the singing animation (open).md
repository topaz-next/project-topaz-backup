This happens when the player lockstyles a set that doesn't include their ranged weapon, then equips the ranged weapon and performs a ranged attack.

Can confirm this is still happening with 30180427_2.

I do not have lockstyle on. I *do* use equipset macros to change into gear, but that is the only menu item.

I've tried a few different items for throwing ( pebbles, bonanza balls ) they all do the wrong animation.
