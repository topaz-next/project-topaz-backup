I noticed the Reclamation Marks showing odd values while I was farming IS in Wajaom Woodlands.

Sometimes it showed 0, sometimes in the 60,000 range, sometimes in the 30,000 range.

It looks like this was added to the currencies screen in the Sep 16 2015 update.

It looks like there may be a discrepancy between SE's release notes and client version numbers. My client version is 30150910_3, which would seem to indicate before Sep 16 2015.

I haven't looked into the currency packet for like 3 updates (it changes
every update), as it's basically a waste of time (since it changes every
update).

FYI, the version numbers aren't the date of the patch, but the date that
the patch data was finalized or last built - which may take more than a day
to test and deploy
