This PR adds the basic functions for geo, including the auras or bubbles as some like to call them.
only spells available are as follows:
â€¢ indi-regen
â€¢ indi-poison
â€¢ indi-refresh
â€¢ geo-regen
â€¢ geo-posion
â€¢ geo-refresh

Abilities:
â€¢ Full Circle returns a fraction of mp based on the intial cost of the geo spell and luopans remaing HP

This is a WIP so feel free to test and make changes accordingly.

Credit to zach2good for making this possible and to actually move ahead.

NOTE: the animations when casting will look odd untill the mID for the bells are added if they are not added already.

I'd be okay with the _current_ targeting solutions put into a new GEO/aura branch!

My musing on performance improvements are for "before work is done to add more bubbles" not "before I'll hit the merge button"! You should know by now I'm usually a proponent of "if it's a lot of weight for one person, take the code off their hands to be worked on collaboratively later". ðŸ˜‰ 

(And the one regarding the "reverse-enmity" container for players should be a new branch based on release _anyway_ so we can merge it into both GEO/aura _and_ trust.)

If you want to do some of the easier things, I'll merge after you say "I'm satisfied for now". ðŸ˜ƒ

Can you split the .sql changes to a separate PR, I guess with status_effects.h as well. That way we can reserve this stuff on `release` and work on GEO in a feature branch.

Okay, this PR is now post-April only, targeting an already merged GEO branch from April, based off our release with most of the SQL/headers in it.

I'll do more butchering later to split bubbles, elemental magic, and abilities.

Pushed the final commit for splitting up the branch (geomancer abilities, merits, and adjustments). As the original work in April was merged into our geo branch, going to close this PR so the later work is all fresh new PRs and distinguished from the initial bubble PR.
