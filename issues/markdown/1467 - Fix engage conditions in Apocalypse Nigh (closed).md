----

Shout out to Tantalus for testing this fight and providing notes!

### Spoilers for ROTZ

Ealdnarche_Apoc_Nigh's had some default "hume" family set, which gave him a mobmod increasing his "see" distance from the default 15 to 30.

In Apoc Nigh you spawn 24 yalms away from him, so he sees you and starts the fight as soon as you're in.

Renamed Kam's family to 'Zilart' and applied that to Ealdnarche.
