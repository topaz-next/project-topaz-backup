**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

It is well known that there are things that "build" resistance to certain spells over time. Examples being: 

https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Despot

or

https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Operation_Desert_Swarm

We need a way to build resistance to specific spells. This includes being able to handle consistent **flat duration decreases** like in ODS or **resist rate increases** in Despot. 

This system should support specific resistance to specific spells, resistant to types of spells, and elements of spells.
