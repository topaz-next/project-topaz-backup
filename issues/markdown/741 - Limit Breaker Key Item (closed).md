Nomad Moogle in Ru'Lude Gardens won't give Limit Breaker Key Item after reaching level75, he only offers next Genkai even though I want to stay caped 75 for now. I'm on Canaria Server.

I'm assuming kaincenteno means that Canaria currently has a modified script for the Moogle. [Our current scripting for the Moogle has it bestowing the Limit Breaker as the first check.](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/scripts/zones/RuLude_Gardens/npcs/Nomad_Moogle.lua#L35-L36)
