**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

When you transfer, the NPC will tell you the RANK in the country you are transferring to.
However, the message displayed was the RANK of your current country before the transfer.

I think you can solve this problem if you have a function that allows you to get the RANK of any country.
