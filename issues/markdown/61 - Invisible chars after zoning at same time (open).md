----

When zoning multiple chars at the same time, sometimes a char may be invisible to another. Running to 50 yalms away and back close again shows the invisible char again. Not sure if this is totally isolated to multiboxing.

I think this started happening after support for multiple "zone" servers was added. (Hope I'm using the right terminology.)

This may be a related to Darkstar Issue 2202.

Revision: 982f0b0
Server: Classic

A note about isolation to multiboxing: this has definitely occurred where the two players (one of whom couldn't see the other) are totally different IPs, computers, people. However, I don't know if one or the other of those people were also multiboxing separately. 

And, I confirm that the problem can always be solved by having someone run >50y, and then running back.

more information:
probably has to do with when I separated the entity update packet types.
 could be because the client receives an incomplete packet update for an ID
that hasn't had a complete (spawn) packet yet, or some other packet
