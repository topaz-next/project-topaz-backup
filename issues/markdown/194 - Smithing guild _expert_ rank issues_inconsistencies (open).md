at 100 points in smithing was told to make a *BLANK ITEM* for promotion. So, checked the crafting.lua and saw that the last item "Gorkhali Kukri" was not entered into the table. Put it in the table, reloadglobal and now he asked for the Gorkhali Kukri (19788). Gave him one and he scolded me about not having my signature on it. (i guess im supposed to make it with an inferno crystal?) he took my item anyway and broke my level cap allowing me to rise to 110.

I don't think 100-110 is implemented (on purpose)

Is there a way to have those NPCs not ask for the item to go beyond 100? Better off not confusing people with something that doesn't work.

i was thinking the same thing, though there are a lot of parameters to this npc and i was having a hard time figuring it out

I think... if you take out the last rank and skill check here it won't ask for the last test.

e: If removing it works, just comment it out for whenever someone decides to implement it. I'm guessing the main reason it's not implemented is because there currently isn't a way to check the signature on an item. ie. someone would need to make a lua binding for that.

Hmm. Craft rank cap might be worth a setting someday, since retail used to stop at 100 and now doesn't. Right now since doesn't work properly past 100 though I'm not opposed to disabling/commenting out post 100 stuff. I only know 1 server trying to do post 100 and they already did custom non-retail stuff to get that working anyway.
