_Originally opened as DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 1561_

----

I read issue Darkstar Issue 1538 and have repeated it numerous times on my SCH. Cast a helix on a worm, so that it takes 4-5 ticks to kill the worm. After the second to last tick the worm becomes unclaimed. On the last tick, the worm dies unclaimed, and I do not receive any experience points.

I would think the real issue here is that the mob came unclaimed before it should have.

why should it not have? if you cast helix and then do nothing, why is it surprising that it eventually became unclaimed?

Because its still dott'ed and dotted mobs don't unclaimed normally? Is helix diff from other dots like that on retail? You tell me.

It'll eventually declaim,  but just poison is usually enough to hold something for quite a while before it happens. I just assumed he's reporting it because it happened faster than normal.

Otherwise...unclaimed mob, not supposed to grant you exp anyway, and killer is correct to be null/nil.

Yes, it does seem to come unclaimed really fast. I haven't timed it, but 4-5 ticks of a helix doesn't seem like much time at all.

Does poison and other dots hold claim on retail? I don't remember.

I I don't know if its dot itself or just the enmity + a short grace period (unless you switch targets, then you lose it instantly thats another thing dsp doesn't have yet).

I could be wrong though. Best to get someone on retail to try a few diff duration dots while pinning and see if they always stay past the duration and past the enmity generated.
