Using capture data provided in the captures discord by Wiggo, ibm2431, and Jimmayus I corrected many of the NM levels in CoP BCNM mission fights. Thanks to those 3 for providing the data. I've attached the .log data from their captures to make it easy for reviewers.

**Note: Currently Diabolos is 10 levels higher than he should be but I left that untouched because some of his abilities don't work correctly, so I assumed that was an intentional change. I assumed the same for Tenzen, although I have not tested him yet in-game on Topaz only DSP (he appeared to be 5 levels too high).

So retail legit has randomized levels in a range on what used to be level capped fights? No winder sometimes it felt like rolling dice till we "got the easy one to load" - we really did get a weaker foe sometimes!
