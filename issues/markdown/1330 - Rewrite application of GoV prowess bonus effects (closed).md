* Correct a misspelling in EFFECT_PROWESS_CRYSTAL_YIELD
* Table prowess buffs.  Each buff has its own maximum stack size. [Fixes #640]

I tested this by:
1. Going to Korroloka tunnel, taking page 2 (Seeker and Combats), and putting the page on repeat.
2. Adding in some temporary code so that I'd complete the page on every kill.
3. Killing bats, and getting a prowess buff on each completion, until I stopped getting buffed.
4. Checking actual power of each prowess effects, against expected max power. All values matched.
5. Removing the temporary code from step 2.
