Unsure if the sleep mob > mob deaggros > mob despawns is known or not but this is affecting these two Antlions. If you sleep these guys, they deaggro, go underground, and become untargetable. Our GM had to despawn them with command

I couldn't get it to respawn either. Someone with a brain needs to debug this.

For whatever reason, the mobs don't actually despawn on deaggro like they should be doing. Because of that, they can't be respawned.

The mobs, after deaggroing, go underground and are only occasionally reaggroed via linking with another Antlion. When reaggroing happens, sometimes the Antlion is "invisible" and are not able to be targeted.
