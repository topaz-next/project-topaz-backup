http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Lightbringer
I have completed Coming of Age, I have maxed out my Rank Points, and do not see Lightbringer mission from the gate guard as a San D' Orian, so cannot accept the mission.

I did note at the end of 8-1, I should get this:
Wait 1 minute and then enter Northern San d'Oria for a final cutscene.

I did not get that final CS. Could this have something to do with it?

Could this be the same root cause as github/DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 3018? Because of dual+ boxing?
