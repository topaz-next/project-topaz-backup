The issue where pets that 'uncharm' while engaged will not become aggressive toward their former master has returned. Also, the 'uncharmed' mob is not cleared from the enmity list of the mob it was attacking while charmed, again.  I know both of these things were just fixed... did it get accidently reverted or something?
