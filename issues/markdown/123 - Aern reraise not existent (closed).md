<!-- Issues will be closed without being looked into if the following information is missing (unless its not applicable). -->

**_Client Version_** (type `/ver` in game) **:** 30160329_1

**_Server Version_** (type `revision` in game) **:** Not sure (UNKNOWN). I rebuilt on May 1st.

**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:** master

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**
 All Aern mobs do not reraise. They should die, plop to the ground, and then randomly subanim 3 and come back to life. Ix DRK doesn't reraise either, but needs to reraise multiple times.

Ideally, needs a mobmod with the value considered; mobmod of 30 would be reraising 30 times, decrementing by 1 each time. This would assume all the subanimations are the same and Aern family only.

For normal aerns it's roundabout a 50% chance they reraise once, and if they've reraised once they will not reraise if killed a second time.

A normal aern killed twice will yield exp for both kills, but will only award drops for the second kill.

Edit: they reraise red-claimed to whoever killed them. They have trace hate on anyone who was on the active hate list when they died.

Doubtful that I will bother with a mobmod.  Most likely as a script mixin,
but I'll have to add something to be able to pop the death/despawn state

Hello. I'm unable to reproduce this issue on master as of 03/09/2020 (Aern were reraising, can't confirm the % but they were, and not 100%). Feel free to reopen an issue if you come across something new regarding this. Thank you.
