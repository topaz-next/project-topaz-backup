_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1077_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

I have tested it several times but have requested @jarmengaud  to double check that all dialogs and bcnms can be completed fully (including re-acquiring keyitem) without having a dead end.

Only minor issue should be that the fight is challenging (mob level is appropriate, stats are correct) and that atori aggroes on sight (unsure where this was, if its under behavior or aggro (currently behavior = 0, aggro = 1)

I'm closing my old PR as I didnt noticed that i started working on a different branch :sweat_smile: Please review this but don't merge until @jarmengaud  has provided feedback with the fight.

At a quick glance, everything looks pretty good! Don't worry too much about the conflicts, I'll extract the sql out and push it straight into the db in a few days so you don't have to worry about re-aligning things. (I'll probably try and do that for all the open PRs and features)
