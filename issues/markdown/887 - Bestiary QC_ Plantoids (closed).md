Included in this PR:

* Added missing apostrophes to mob_spawn_points.polutils_name.

* Changed Sauromugue_Skink and Thunderclaw_Thuban family from panopt to raptor.

* Realized that wiki was missing a few mobs from its bestiary category lists, so I revisited the categories from my previous PR (beasts, lizards, vermin), cross-checked each by family, found the missing mobs, and QCed them as well.  Going forward I'll use both wiki and family-crosscheck to find as many mobs as possible.

* QCed against retail members of the "Plantoids" category.  Put each species in its own commit for easier reviewing.
