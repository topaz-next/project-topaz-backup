I'm holding off on merge due to the char_var name change. I _personally_ feel the chances of a server having a character who triggered the wait but never finished it are very slim, so I'd be willing to merge as-is. But I'll leave this open in case someone wants to make the argument for a migration script.

(We can make sure the var name change is mentioned in whatever @zircon-tpl is planning for the next digest~)

I'm happy to use the old name, it's pretty obvious what it does when you look at it with context and I'd rather not burden operators with a migration for such a little fix.
