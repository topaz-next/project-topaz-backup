_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1492_

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

There are many comments in the codebase in Russian, leftover from previous ancestor projects. It would be useful for someone to go in and Google Translate them (or properly translate them if you are so able), and to sanity check the resulting new comment.

I suspect a lot of these comments are obvious in what they're pointing out, and some are probably overkill, and can be removed.
