People can pull him upstairs out of the room/range for blood aggro

Interesting, last I heard Vrtra got stuck on the open door to exit its area.

This is one of several mobs on the "needs specialized draw-in regions" list.

In terms of Vrtra behavior: draw in should be single target and go off when Vrtra's target is > ~20' away or outside of the door to the room. There is an invisible line in front of the exit door that retail Vrtra will not cross under any circumstances. The other two grand wyrms have similar "do not cross" lines in their respective fight areas if someone wants to code all 3 at once.

It's also going to be fairly critical that the draw in does not get people stuck under the floor the way Tiamat's still will.
