Resolved a lot of the comments. (And sorry about the whitespacing. Used VIM which took my default style and I hadn't thought about it before I pushed.)

Left 2 comments to go. Will watch the capture to handle some of the option choices that vary from the ones I was able to decipher from videos on Youtube.

Resolved all the comments and reworked the state machine to match all possible options from the capture.

Please take another look.
