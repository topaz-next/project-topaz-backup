Fixes #1292 

Rather than fixing Thunder Hawk's npcUtil option from **ki** to **keyItem** (See #1292), I decided to go the other way with the fix, and rename the option to **ki** for consistency.  Updated all references in codebase.

Also switched some references to the short-hand **tpz.ki**
