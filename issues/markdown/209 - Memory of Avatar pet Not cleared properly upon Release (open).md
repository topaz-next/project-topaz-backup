The windower addon "PetTP" doesn't recognize the name of any of my pets (DRG, BST, SMN.. etc.)
As opposed to using the same addon with retail:
![petname](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30469395/36543068-4959d0b0-17a8-11e8-914b-276297f49ca6.jpg)
DSP tracks the pet's Health and TP just fine and displays it in "PetTP" but just not the name. Also, upon dismissing my pet, the addon will switch to provide info for another party member's pet (even if they are not in the same zone). 

NOTE: This is NOT an issue for 'Windower' or the addon 'PetTP' I am merely using those tools to show behaviors in order to hopefully track down the initial Headline DSP issue.

Here's a new one: 
![pet_memory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30469395/36758482-35438356-1bda-11e8-9c6d-fee4d54cacac.jpg)
It thinks I still have a Gloop. I'm pretty sure it's just not cleared from the memory properly.
