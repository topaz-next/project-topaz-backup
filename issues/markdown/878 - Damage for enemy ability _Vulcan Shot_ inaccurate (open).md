_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 878_

**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

During the Treasures of Aht Urhgan mission "The Black Coffin", the enemy "Ashu Talif Captain" uses an ability "Vulcan Shot". The damage this ability inflicts is seemingly too high. Secondly, the ability is lacking the "Defense Down" status effect which it inflicts.

A successful resolution will cite a source -- or multiple sources -- for what the newly adjusted damage values are based on.
