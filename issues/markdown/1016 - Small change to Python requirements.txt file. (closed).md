A small change to automatically download the latest version instead of a specific one. 8.0.21 being ahead of our listed one (8.0.20), been tested for weeks and nothing broke there.

With the dbtool becoming our default database management tool and pydarstar being the same, any small issue will be highlighted pretty quick!

Thank you Kreidos for confirming!
