1000 Needles (Hanatori, Lower Right): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy9t26F8_l4&t=34m - 1000 damage

Water Shot (Astrena, Lower Left): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy9t26F8_l4&t=42m50s - 206 damage

Astrena's regular QD in Espial is 260 (Can see on Five Moons earlier at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy9t26F8_l4&t=24m19s)
102 Eminent Gun + 3 Bronze Bullet = 105, 105 * 2 = 210.
210 * 1.24 (100 + 24 MAB from /RDM sub / 100 Base MDB) = 260

Astrena had 3000 TP at the time Water Shot went off on the Ahriman, so the latent on Eminent Gun was no longer active:
97 Eminent Gun + 3 Bronze Bullet = 100, 100 * 2 = 200
200 * 1.2 (100 + 24 MAB / 100 + 20 MDB) = 206.667, floored

Edit: Eminent Gun's latent resulting in lower damage can be seen after it transforms into Nicholas (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy9t26F8_l4&t=43m20s), resulting in a 750 damage 1000 Needles and a 248 damage QD:
(97 + 3) * 2 = 200
200 * 1.24 (100 + 24 MAB / 100 Base MDB) = 248

So the only thing with MDB in the fight was the Ahriman. It did not have MDT; only Nicholas did.

It means more Dispels, 1000 Needles, and Quick Draws are needed - on stated targets.

The capture shows an Ahriman with 0% MDT and 20 MDB. This is the _reverse_ of what this Pull Request does.

I will translate: Ibm is saying Teo wrong, mob in log parse showing no mdt.

Precise MDT is given by 1000 Needles, which is an AoE Magical Attack when used by BLU players. Target needs to be fully Dispelled to not have Shell affecting the number.

Here is what happens to 1000 Needles damage when the target has Shell
Log excerpt from: https://youtu.be/H6tVvHDgI0Q
[1000_needles.txt](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/files/5170575/1000_needles.txt)


MDB is given by the way [Quick Draw damage is calculated](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Quick_Draw). It ignores MDT. Provided you're not resisted, you can calculate a mob's MDB if you know your own MAB and use a Quick Draw that isn't affected by day/weather.

Final final revisions done for this family according to Ibm's research.  Possibly will need to be tweaked in the future, but we now know that -25% MDT is plain wrong, and both wiki and bgwiki are wrong.

This change is simple enough, there's not much need to go through a merge and waiting for CI - going to merge ðŸ’£
