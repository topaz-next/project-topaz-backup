_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 756_

----

This was entirely made up.

NMs which have been CONFIRMED to have HP values that aren't in line with the standard growth scale should have their HP manually set instead.

I didn't see any stat bonuses but there is also an MP bonus applied right after this, dunno if you want to get that as well.

I was originally tempted to remove the stat multiplier, but expected its removal to be met with resistance, so stuck with just the HP since there's a specific config setting I could point to.

But if we all want to remove the stat multiplier too, I will _happily_ delete it.

I didn't see the MP bonus, I'll delete that too. (Although "mob MP" will be a discussion for another time.)

edit: Oh, there's an NM stat multiplier in map.conf already. So out the vanilla stat multiplier goes.

Didn't even see those multipliers next to the conf settings, good eye!
