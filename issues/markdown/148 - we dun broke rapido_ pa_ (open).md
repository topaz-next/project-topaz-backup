~~In addition to Darkstar Issue 866 his AI now never engages, doesn't become claimed, and doesn't fight back. But will still counter. And~~ his pathing halts shortly after spawning. I fixed the missing require with eb97e4f9b8a53c7a0c6532125c6da0b6a96485a3 but this still happens. He just freezes solid.

Looks like the pathing probs are just bad positioning smacking him into navmesh, giving him new pos's in his path table fixes that part. ~~His failure to claim or fight back is a separate problem though.~~

I'm aware of how he works on retail. ~~He runs around so fast he's next to impossible to hit with anything and even if you macro land a provoke he'll fly off and declaim. But he **does** claim and he certainly doesn't stand there letting you beat on him like a Pi√±ata..~~

~~On retail after he links to a sabotender you still have to actually claim him..~~

~~`ROAMFLAG_IGNORE  = 0x200, // ignore all hate, except linking hate`
No such thing as "linking hate". This was implemented all wrong by taking peoples comments on the internet literally instead of someone actually observing it on retail.~~

~~clarification for anyone comes along still confused: he should auto de-claim and disengage himself, not be unclaimable.~~

Fuggit, I can't get it to happen on camera to prove how it works. If we fix the pathing he's "good enough". _Assuming he starts noticing the sabotender fighting next to him once he's moving again._
