If this is just going to be SQL (and maybe minor .h changes), do _me_ a favor and target release~

That way you can do _Wiggo_ a favor and define the zoneFlags for Adventuring Fellow too, and then we can merge release into both `trust` and `adventuringfellow` while updating the animations in `release`

We may need to give the nameless TP moves names. A naming convention eludes me at the moment, but I believe some of these might need scripts.

@ibm2431 Sometimes the packet will have a name even if the dat does not. In the cases where its the entities melee animations (tp skill as special melee) I have been using `mobname_special_melee` in all lowercase. Legion had done up a ton of these but I think the server shut down without anyone sharing them back. Accurate animations on most of them. :(

Since I'm greedy and I want these caps for my next trust feature PR, I've wiped out the (possibly) incorrect skill list entries for Sekhmet and the Aern skills. I think the impact will be nearly unnoticeable and if someone flags them up then that gives us a chance to fix them _for reals_
