A missing script isn't a bug, it's just not implemented.

Just because it's not implemented doesn't mean there can't be an issue, it's not exclusively for bugs.

if I recall correctly nobody has tackled the prob of it trying to apply its damage after it applies the sleep effect without giving up partway into the attempt yet.

Can you just apply the damage then apply sleep after to get around that issue?

The issue of effects getting removed by the damage exists precisely because you donâ€™t have that ability in scripts - the damage happens at the end. We need to refactor how these work to let you do that.

We had this is ws's too. Even if you have the dmg call then the effect call, the core processed the 2nd last.
