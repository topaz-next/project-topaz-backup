**_I have:_**

- [*] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated 

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Completed quest up to the fight at the Navukgo Execution chamber; returned to Whitegate and spoke to Waoud to get the KI, then Lathuya for a cutscene where she says her boss is in Aydeewa Subterrane. 

Entered Aydeewa via the entrance at K-9/10 as instructed in the walkthroughs, found the exact map described (No aggro en route except a leech sitting on a ledge out of aggro range.  Clicked the blank spot near the water as instructed, and it says "There is nothing out of the ordinary here," as though the quest had not been started.

Returned to Whitegate and spoke to Lathuya again, which triggered the exact same cutscene I got the first time.  Spoke to her again immediately afterwards and the same CS repeated.

Sealed immortal envelope is still in my temporary key items following viewing the cs with Lathuya 3 times.
