**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
I'd really like to see somebody adjusting/confirming the mob_anim_time and mob_prepare_time on these instead of every skill using the defaults or copy pasta values. (2000/1000 and 2000/1500 on nearly every one of them..)

For anyone with access to retail, this is a simple issue to go after. Pick a skill, record a mob using it, and then adjust till you can produce a near identical recording from Darkstar master.
