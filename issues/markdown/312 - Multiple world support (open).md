----

I'm basically trying to create the option to support multiple world (map servers) from a single login server. Just to be clear I'm not expecting anyone else to bother, rather I'm trying to code this myself and just need some assistance since I'm new to the code. Right now I'm trying to figure out how to add more than one server name when creating a character.

I've narrowed it down to LOBBY_024_RESERVEPACKET in mmo.h, which is a binary hex blob into which the server name is copied. I have no idea what each field in the packet means so if someone knows anything about it please tell me. Also please refer me to any packet dumping tools that I can use to capture the packet from retail so I can compare.

Many thanks for your assistance, please help a new developer join!
