Fixes #1337 

After combat, trust healing ticks will come in after 15s, 10s, 10s and then every 3s.
This counter is reset if the trust is hit, so they can't tank while being hit by stuff.

Checked against retail by counting in my head when the ticks happen, and writing down the amounts so I can work out the differences.
They're all 5% (still)
