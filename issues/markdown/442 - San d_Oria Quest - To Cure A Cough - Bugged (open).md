**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
The Diary in the house next to Amaura is not supposed to be able to be read past Page 2 unless "The Medicine Woman" is completed. I was able to read all 4 pages prior to completion, causing me to be permanently bugged when starting To Cure A Cough. I received proper quest dialogue from Nenne, but Amaura simply says she's busy making potions.
