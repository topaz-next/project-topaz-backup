Looks like this is because of an out-of-bounds access on the `battleutils.cpp` (it stops at 99) See: `GetMaxSkill` trying to access the `g_SkillTable` but there are only entries up to 99 on the actual skill table SQL. 

Should we put a guard in place here? And what should we put for these values? Do we have new values to put here?

Also, hi. New person looking to contribute here. :)

Yes. 

Which is pretty much because we don't really have any post 99 support yet. Which needs to eventually change. In my opinion should be capable of monster levels clear to 255 just in case of any future higher level monsters. I think retail has some above 130 now, I don't know exactly. Oldschool I think highest lv mobs were lv95 wyrms.

Maybe in the meantime we could treat above 99 as if it is exactly 99.

A quick `grep` through the source code seems to indiciate that you guys already treat above `99` as the max level, since there are some checks elsewhere that do `if level > 99, clamp to 99` so that seems like a reasonable thing to do.

We do that elsewhere. We just didn't do it *here* yet. We should, and then later put some actual care into making non oldschool situations accurate. But that'll probably be long ways into the future. I kept forgetting this existed so I tossed it into the tracker so it wouldn't get lost (_also "maybe someone else will fix it before I get around to it" Pull Requests welcome_).

I think retail just caps it at 99 as well and then tack on extra stats.
Kind of like item level in Adoulin gear

I've seen packets where the level field was populated as "120". That could still be from being an "effective" level though, for exp purposes, I guess we could see wtf happens to level correction'd things on a high enough mob and tha'd give us an idea of what retail does.
