So considering SQL calls a value of 16 for every ranged ws. I think someone ninja updated ranger ws's in the core. First noticed this after a January update on ERA. reproduced on my test server. Its super OP alot of Linkshells tend to just Ranger Burn everything that have dangerous AoE moves. Id like to see it made a little more interesting and retail like. Wish I understood the core files more to help.

Also depending on the mob family size, set to 1 its 19.9(shown in screen shot) in which you can use a ws from. Keeps going up as the mob family size increases as well and since most Endgame has big mobs you can get onward of 21+ yalms in which you can ws from.

Ranger burning things with dangerous tp moves is exactly how retail works

lol yeah i get that but you still had to run in  to ws and get back out of harms way tactically after mobs skills like  gates etc.right now you can flat out TP and WS at 20+

You didn't have to move to use a WS. The only ranged WS that needs to be
close is blast shot

Its mob family size that changes the distance, and yeah technically the way its coded essentially increases your distance for all weaponskills weather thats intended for ranged skills, I don't know. You don't need to increase it too much tho.. A family size of 4 is sufficient for most of the bigger mobs you would encounter as a dps or tank and only allows you an increase of 2 yalms (tested on a sandworm model as a PLD). Its a great fix for making it so you don't have to be inside the model just to be in range.. But as has unwanted(at least to me) side effects for ranger weapon skills.. Now this being said it doesn't however affect Magic distance. As for the AoE value you previously mentioned(I'm guessing you saw this on the weapon skill table) I'm pretty certain that just allows dmg on one target or multiple targets.

DB shows Blast Shot as even further away lol `...` 
Wiki shows 5 yalms `...`
http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Distance

15.8'	
Maximum range for most ranged Weapon Skills (excluding Blast Arrow, Blast Shot).

17.7'	
Maximum range for Detonator and Empyreal Arrow.

17.2'	
Maximum range for Jishnu's Radiance.

Just sayin `...`

Also Coronach falls into the 15.8' category making the database entry of 16 correct `...` 
Like I said before, you actually  TP beyond the range of 20' yalm mob skills and quickly run in to pop off a weapons skill after a mob uses their TP then you gtfo out again... Ranger 101 `...` 
I mean, if you were the one who changed no biggie.. just wanted yas to know its terribly wrong and extremely over powered.

I see, I did not understand your initial comment, then.

Can't do anything until we can confirm whether ranged weaponskills should take monster radius into account, and whether monster aoe moves should also take monster radius into account.

Hozu  nevermind teschnei made me understand your comment.

Yeah dude glad you understand me now.. Basically something in the core is totally by passing the values set in the DB for the maximum range in which you can use various ranged type weapon skills.

Also this recently just became an issue, wasnt like this 2 months ago. If that helps.

I'm all for this remaining the same as there really isn't really another way around it when taking into account melee's, all I'm saying is its definitely hardcoded somewhere right now at 20 in the core(Recent change) and it should be 16 or deleted so the DB can control it.

Confirmed, mob family size does not increase the AOE range of the mob skills used(tested with Gates of hades with multiple mob sizes, 20 yalms every time. Apply this to ranged ws? Recode rng ws to work off db? Find the hardcode for 20 and set to 16?

yeah im just saying even with a default radius of 1( a beach bunny, lizzard, anything tiny..) you can still pop off ws from 20 yalms away all i was getting at with the family size was its increaseing it even more to like 21ish.... no ifs an or buts that broken af. look at my screen shot. you'll see im using coronach on a cockatrice with mob size of 1 from a really exploitable distance( should be 16 my distance plugin is up in the top right corner.

When comparing retail to DSP for distances, remember that this issue also exists: github/DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 2904

I don't know if this will help or not (since I am not a code monkey like ya'll are) but on retail, ranger had a 'sweet spot' for weapon skills, which doesn't seem to apply on DSP servers from my experience.  You can be in melee range and fire off Sidewinder, for example, and it'll be fine, but on retail, you had to be at a distance for the WS to be more accurate/effective.  I wanna say something like.. between 12-15 on the Distance plugin (it's been a while, so I forget for sure)?  I dunno how many 'yalms' that is though.

hope that helps.  if not, feel free to ignore lol

Yeah it's a ranged attack penalty based on distance, and it's different between bow, crossbow, and gun. Problem is there wasn't data for each distance range so it's not implemented. I think there's an outstanding issue open for this.

tbh i dont care really about any of the other issues.. lol i just want to either see 1 the hardcode removed and allow us to control ws range based on DB again(like it was a few months back) or two change the hardcode from 20' to 16'.  I just watched 6 rangers all standing 20'+ and all unloaded on a dark ixion  and also sarameya and its really sad to see.

I'm just starting to browse the source and it looks like a lot of stuff that's hardcoded should be set up dynamically.

A complete overhaul might fix a lot of ooen issues.
