Nanaa Mihgo now increases the charVar bit responsible for this to not make her repeat the dialogue regarding this quest. The remaining NPCs involved in "Crying for Onions" got their bit increased accordingly. Tested working locally and extensively by talking to every NPC before the quest, in every step during the quest, and after the quest.
Closes #880

Trying to git amend on behalf of the Style Guide suggestions left me with a broken merge conflict which I am unable to resolve,...sigh. Line 93-94 should be below the comment `"-- Wild Card"`

did you happen to try and pull after amending? coz you don't want to do that if git push errors, the error would likely be from failing to do a force push instead of a regular push.
