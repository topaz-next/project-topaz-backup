When warping around sky the option is 3 and would not charge the player.

We should no longer call setPos on the player as the event will handle teleporting the player.  We may also consider removing the x,y,z, rotation and zone from the table.

Hello. I'm unable to produce any issue regarding Homepoint teleports in Sky on master as of 03/09/2020. It was probably fixed in Nation teleport changes PR by Cryptexx back in october 2019. Feel free to reopen an issue if you come across something new. Thank you.
