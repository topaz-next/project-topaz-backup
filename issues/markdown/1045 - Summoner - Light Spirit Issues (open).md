**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Forwarding from https://github.com/GoldSaucerServer/bugtracker/issues/107:

"Light Spirit's behavior is unique in that it can be divided into 3 different modes.

Light Spirit will always only cast the highest tier of the spells that come in a series.
Attacking Mode
This behavior is triggered if the Light Spirit commanded to Assault a mob. It is also triggered when the Light Spirit auto-attacks a mob who has main hate on the Summoner.
In attacking mode, the behavior of Light Spirit is almost identical to the Elemental Cycle spirits, except that in place of elemental magic skill based spells, it casts divine magic skill-based spells instead.
Light Spirit cannot cast any attacking area of effect spells.
In addition to the spell repertoire for its offensive mode, the Light Spirit can still cast buffing mode spells while it is engaged.
Healing Mode
This behavior is triggered when members of your party or alliance have yellow or red HP.
Light Spirit use either the highest Cure or Curaga spell depending on how many members in the party or alliance have low HP. However, it can still cast Curaga spells even when you are playing solo.
Light Spirit can cast all its healing spells on any member of your alliance This feature is unique to the Light Spirit only.
Buffing Mode
This is the default mode that the Light Spirit is in when it does not have a battle target.
In Buffing Mode, Light Spirit's spirit timer is halved.
There are only 4 types of spells Light Spirit can cast (i.e Protect, Shell, Regen and Haste). Light Spirit cannot cast -ra buffs, bar-spells or -na spells.
Light Spirit will overwrite lower tiered Protect and Shell spells but will not overwrite Haste or Regen.
Light Spirit does not cast buffs on players who are under the Invisible status.
Light Spirit cannot cast buffs on itself.
Light Spirit can only cast Regen I and not II or III
Light Spirit can be encouraged to cast its buff spells on party members by having it face towards a party member.

The buffing mode doesn't seem to work at all only the attacking mode. I summoned light spirit and sat idle for few mins and nothing happened." - Eren@GS
