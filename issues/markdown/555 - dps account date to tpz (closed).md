Hi @siguma-zero, welcome!

Sadly, I believe your issue here will be closed as this isn't the place to seek support. Issue trackers are for reporting bugs or incorrect behaviour of the program and not for help requests. I recommend you engage with the friendly and helpful project members and users on [the Discord](https://discord.gg/nbYJfA5) in order to seek assistance. 

If, in your time with Topaz you encounter issues which are the direct result of a bug, I know it would be appreciated if you reported them here.
