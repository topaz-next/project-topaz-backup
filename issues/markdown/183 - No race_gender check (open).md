**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**

Using gearsets, and I'm assuming addons, there's no server side race or gender check, so you could be a male in a opaline set, use any RSE gear you wanted, etc. This information is not even in the stock DSP database.

I have a table with all the information, and a complete fix, if anyone wants it, but I figured someone else should be aware of it.

Does retail even have those checks? I remember this being a thing long ago where sometimes people would get a GM called on them for using RSE of a different race. So if this can be done on current retail then it's technically accurate, and warrants an option to enforce race/gender-specific gear restrictions at best.

Hozu I think yer right but I didn't thinka that before I sent'em to gihub. I think it'd be an acceptable option at the least. *"If galka's cross dressing are is your thing turn this setting off."*

Hozu You can do this on retail. If you did and the game didn't have a .dat for it you, like the case of the crossdressing Galka, it would just look like you were wearing leather armor. Same for like the Judges set on a non Hume. Using something like Wardrobe or another program or addon allows you to equip them no questions asked, as it is all client sided.

I don't know about retail, but I can't imagine an oversight like this would have lasted long. Taru's equipping galka RSE gear would make huge MP pool, same as galka equipping taru RSE would have the same effect on HP.

TeoTwawki maybe not an entire new table, just a new column. Either way, the data is available.

ctoon50 it is using 3rd party tools so you cant just trust the client like dsp is *which is what was being discussed*

Not even 3rd party programs, but gearsets, in macro's, lets you do it in DSP. Which means it lets you do it in the client. I don't know if retail lets you do it though for the client or if there's server side checks.

retail probably moved (or will) from client side to server checks after they  oticed this. I know ppl were landing in mordion over it.

last I saw they blocked it in macro etc but if you sent the right packet it still equipped

I had a report about forcing gear similar but that was sounding like they meant the same piece was in all slots.. pretty sure we enforce slot typse checks and so did not think of race check thing at the time. they may have meant to tell me it was rse in all slots like that.

Just logged into retail it shows white in your inventory like you are able to equip it, but aren't able to equip them anymore. Looks like it was changed to a server side check. Using sexchange and Ashitacast I was not able to equip them either. But pretty sure AC has checks to prevent you doing this anyway. As a side effect you cannot use your client to directly equip your actual races RSE, but you can using Ashitacast. Assuming the same for Windower and Gearswap. Char is normally a Hume Female btw not a taru.

So they did fix it. Not surprising at all. Guess all that's needed in the DB is a bitmask for each equip for (in)eligible races, and then a check in the core, wherever that would be.
