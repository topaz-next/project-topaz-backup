**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Some monster families don't use all of their TP moves. Tested across multiple zones from different expansions/add-ons when applicable.
This issue has the side effect of making certain Blue Magic spells inaccessible.

Known affected monster families:
- Rafflesia don't use any TP moves.
- Ruszors don't use any TP moves.
- Wivres don't use any TP moves.
- Gnoles only use Fevered Pitch and Asuran Claws.
