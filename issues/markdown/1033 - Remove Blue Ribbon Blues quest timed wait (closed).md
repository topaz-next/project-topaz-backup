- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

The in game wait timer was removed from Blue Ribbon Blues quest in 2014/2015.  Updating Kerutoto to reflect this so players don't wonder what they did wrong (nothing).

This hasn't been tested, but it should be 100% good to go.  Thanks to rbrashear12@GoldSaucer for reporting it.
