3. Have your buddy trade you an item.
4. Note the error message "You cannot trade" due to you having no spots available for the trade
5. Have your buddy trade you the same item but this time, include an item of your own in the trade window.
6. Note the "trade complete" message.
7. Also, note that your item was never received from your buddy and you now have 1 spot available.
  --the item just disappears into the nothingness never to be seen again
8. Also, note the if both players inventories are completely full and a trade happens between them, only 1 of the items traded will disappear into the void.

I'm guessing on retail both parties must have enough space before the trade
starts

That is correct, and gil counts as an item. So, even with 1 slot (and i just did this on retail) you cannot accept an item plus gil.

It appears https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/387 fixes and should have closed this issue but somehow Github didn't notice.
