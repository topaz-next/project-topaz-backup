Just pop into the location on a fresh boot up server to see him walk to his final destination. Once he reaches  {-139.296539, -2.000000, 16.786556} he won't move anymore.  He is supposed to stop at {-14.421194, 1.700000, -29.379389} and {-140.205811, -2.000000, 15.668728} infront of another NPC but he ignores the npc:wait()

There's also no text showing thanking for the delivery.

I've noticed it, too; with this NPC and others. Considering how convoluted the path scripts are now, it's difficult to troubleshoot. I usually just make my own path scripts to get away from it.
