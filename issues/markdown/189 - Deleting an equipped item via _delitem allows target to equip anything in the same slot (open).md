**_Server Version_** (type `!revision` in game) **:** 21ce4ef05b5cf78ca97a6d778b4d392fe5334189 _(Note: this commit link will take you to my testing fork, but all that's been modified there at this point are some NPC scripts and TextIDs.)_


**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:** master


**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
1) Equip a weapon (tested with Sapara of Trials, 17654)
2) Place a different weapon in Mog Wardrobe (tested with Kodachi of Trials, 17773), make sure no other items of that type are in player's (non-storage) inventory.
3) Call !delitem on the equipped weapon
-- Weapon is deleted.
4) Move the other weapon from wardrobe into your inventory
-- Other weapon is equipped, even if player does not meet the requirements for it.
**Attempting to attack at this point causes the map server to crash with the following error:** 
> ([Fatal Error] --- gdb backtrace ---)

- Was able to equip a katana that requires 71 NIN, as a 75 WAR. 
- Works with armor too, but player does not benefit from armor stats.
- Items are unequipped on changing zones.

That's uh... interesting. When I wrote the command I merely saw that an equipped item was visually removed (ie. no longer showing as equipped in the slot), so I never bothered to try anything else. At the time the only other use of the delItem binding was for COR Quick Draw deleting cards, so I wasn't quite sure how this would work out.

If the only way to trigger this is with a gm command, then it's not really
a big problem

we could prolly just force unequip the item in the command script just before deleting it though without any hassle..leave it to the minions to pr.
