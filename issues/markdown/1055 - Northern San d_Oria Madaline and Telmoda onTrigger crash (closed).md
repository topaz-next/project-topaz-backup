Welcome to Project Topaz! I'm going to post instructions on how to fix this issue (if you need to apply a hot-fix to your local server), and tag this so that someone else might be able to come along and fix this in our repo, thanks for reporting!

https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/scripts/zones/Northern_San_dOria/npcs/Madaline.lua#L13
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/scripts/zones/Northern_San_dOria/npcs/Telmoda.lua#L14

These are in the form:
```lua
player:setCharVar(player, "Telmoda_Madaline_Event", 1)
```

but should be:
```lua
player:setCharVar("Telmoda_Madaline_Event", 1)
```

I imagine these will trigger a `TPZ_DEBUG_BREAK` when they hit core and the server will die :(
