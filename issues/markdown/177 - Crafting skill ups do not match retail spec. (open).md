> Succeeding at synthesis will offer a chance to skill up even when a player's current synthesis skill level exceeds the recipe's skill level.
> *The difference between the recipe's level and the player's synthesis skill level must not exceed 10.
> Example:
> Current Synthesis skill is 30, recipe skill level is 30:
> → Chance of skilling up.
> Current Synthesis skill is 30, recipe skill level is 20:
> → Chance of skilling up.
> Current Synthesis skill is 30, recipe skill level is 19:
> → No chance of skilling up.
