**_Client Version_** **:** 30180904_0

**_Source Branch_** **:** master

**_Additional Information_** **:** 
The WS is supposed to apply Defense Down lasting 60/120/180 seconds according to [BG Wiki](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Garland_of_Bliss).

Current script gives 60/90/120-second duration and multiplies it with a resistance formula, which...well, is that part necessary? Whatever it's returning, it's reducing the duration by a factor so big, the additional effect wears off within 3 or so seconds.

probably should be applied to a check if the effect happens at all rather than effect duration (I am guessing. Otherwise our resistance formula is very seriously useless)

I'd guess it's using the wrong skill or something if it's always giving
high resists

I mean, duration is already adjusted by TP. Do we know for sure it has partial resist effecting duration as well as sticking it? Reist check on duration seems like we'd not get that 60/90/120 split. unless I missed something.

I tried using the weaponskill again with /BLM, magic accuracy food, and Elemental Seal active (dunno if that contributes anything), and the Defense Down wore off much later than I was used to. Perhaps the resistance checking on WS additional effects needs to give players a boost? It appears caster level is the only thing powering it looking at magic.lua. And food of course, but I figure most jobs' weaponskills' additional effects are supposed to be serviceable without relying heavily on magic accuracy food like crepes.

I'm looking through a Japanese wiki/board of sorts circa 2008 and the comments don't seem to mention anything about duration resists. If the BRD mythic has a "% chance of applying gravity" based on TP while the SMN mythic has simply "duration" based on TP then I think that makes it clear that there shouldn't be. Also, the 60/120/180 durations are apparently legit based on some other comments, so those could be changed here, at least.

Edit: That said, moving the resist check to applying the status break itself only shifts the problem. Instead of the effect always landing but for very short durations, they would hardly land at all. It's also quite interesting how a single crepe overcame the resist rate. There's something suspicious there.

Not necessarily true. We can specify what resist tier its checked against for example: always land unless FULL resisted, which **should not** be happening all that often..


**But yeah I don't think something with duration set by tp should also be applying math to its duration based on resist, if resist is involved there it should be changing which tier it lands as.**

I don't think anybody would have arrived at the 60/120/180 or 60/90/120 conclusions if they were regularly getting 3/45/whatever durations because of resists on retail...
