non relevant

**_Server Version_** (type `revision` in game) **:**

**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:**
master

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**
I assume the reason `/nominate` does not work is because its such an under used feature of retail that nobody thought to capture and implement that.
