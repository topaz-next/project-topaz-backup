\<removed>
_Its quickly been pointed out to me in multiple dm's on discord that this is "shots fired". This was NOT my intended meaning and I am 100% the asshole for the misunderstanding I created with my phrasing. It is upsetting and disturbing to me how some viewed this with glee._

_It was never my intent to insult anyone and I apologize for any hurt feelings._
