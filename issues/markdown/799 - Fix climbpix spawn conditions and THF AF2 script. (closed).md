This fixes climbpix's spawn to be accurate with retail.  No longer does it decide and lock in the ??? position for each player after talking to the mithras at the start of the quest, it varies with day.  Also, talking with Nanaa's friends is supposed to be optional, but the topaz script before made it required, which caused grief for players!
