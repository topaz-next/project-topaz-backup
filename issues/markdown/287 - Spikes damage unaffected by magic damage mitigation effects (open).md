**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

1. Confirmed on retail today that blaze spikes damage is reduced by Shell, Barfire, Rampart, and Phalanx - assume all magic damage mitigation effects but these are the ones I tested. 

2. Stood around smacking Profblix with an Onion Sword on a current DSP master build and none of the above made a difference. Funny enough nor did `!godmode` or a Judge's Ring :P

Related issue (still open) = Darkstar Issue 2095.
