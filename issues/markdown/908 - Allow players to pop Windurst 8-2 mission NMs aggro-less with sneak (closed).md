Both cardians were set to auto-target whoever pops them with or without sneak, now they simply spawn if the player has sneak up.  From wiki: "When the Cracked Wall is examined, the following two level 72 Cardians will spawn and they attack immediately unless the character examining the Cracked Wall is under the effect of Sneak."
