Raised Peacock Amulet from 23% to 24% (Very common tier).

Velocious Belt lowered from 6% to 5% (Rare tier).

Trotter Boots raised from 10% to 15% (Common tier), could potentially advocate for 24% (Very Common tier based off TH0 statistics on ffxidb).

Dryad Staff increased from 10% to 24% (Common tier).
Damascus Ingot on Roc lowered from 6% to 5% (Rare tier).

Octave Club lowered from 8% to 5% (Rare tier).

Ridill changed from 18% to 1% drop rate (Very rare tier)...I think perhaps someone meant to have this at 1.8%? Unsure if it should be 5% or 1%, so I put it at 1% for now. Here are sources which advocated
for ~3-6%, I assume they always had TH3-TH4 though so I believe 1% seems more accurate.

http://www.ffxidb.com/zones/154/fafnir

Goblin Enchanter's ingot drop rates adjusted. These plague servers badly because ingot drop rates are set so absurdly high... platinum/gold ingots at 8% when the drop rates shown on ffxidb are 0% (did they even exist) or 0.5% (Super rare tier).

Will look at fixing more drop rates in the future but these are all "high priority" items on 75-cap servers that I was able to quickly check and fix.

(Don't worry about the CI style check, it's been freaking out on SQL checks for some reason...)

It's not a requirement for putting items in this database, but I think most of us have begun tagging what each of these items is (and often what's dropping it) as we add or fix them so that it's quick for reviewers to look at and people scanning the .sql to understand.  Up to you if you want to go back and add comments for them.

skew is a factor no matter what source we go by. for tiers 0/1/2 on ffxidb we can check which columns come close to rate buckets and corroborate each other making our best guess. So if the TH0 column implies common but the TH2 column implies rare, I know one or both columns had some skew going on. Either imperfect sample sizes or other factors. (not sure what happens when in a party with a TH source - does the data collector FFXIDB uses know your party member had TH?)

tl;dr don't expect it to ever be perfect without a leak that we aren't supposed to look at for legal reasons,
