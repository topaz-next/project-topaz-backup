If you try to claim a mob too quickly on retail it will briefly lock you out of claiming the mob. 

This is intended to even the playing field between spells vs JA, botters vs manual claimers, and people who live close to the server vs people who are far away.

Retail's claim shield was around 3 seconds and locked you out for around 3 seconds. There may have been an element of randomness to it.. rather hard to say when it comes to latency. 

Ideally it's high enough to give everyone a shot at claiming in a packed and laggy dragon's aery, whilst still low enough not to annoy a puller shooting a freshly popped mob for their exp group.

Hey Deadwing888 are you ever on IRC? Under a different name or something? I'd like to ask some retail questions.
