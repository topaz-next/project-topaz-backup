**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Dipper Yuly's abilities do not use the correct number of charges.  Both Sudden Lunge and Spiral Spin use 2 Charges when they should use 1.  Both DISPLAY correctly, but when trying to use the ability with 1 charge it will not allow use.

Sudden Lunge does not deal damage and does not stun enemies as it should.

In Testing, it does not seem like Dipper Yuly has Treasure Hunter II as it should.  Tested on enemies that have very high droprate items (Bat Wings) and found that drops did not occur as often as expected compared to TH1 SubJob (Tested separately)

It also does not seem to have the same Evasion Bonus as retail.  Testing on Too Weak enemies it gets hit VERY often, whereas in retail it would not.

To add, Noisome Powder seems to work correctly.
