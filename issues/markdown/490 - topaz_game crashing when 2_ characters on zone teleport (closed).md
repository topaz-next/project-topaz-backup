**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
This is happening on the Canary branch.
When 2+ characters are zoning at the same time from one zone to another it will make the map server crash.

If possible you may want to install **gdb** on your server, this way it should print a stacktrace the next time it crashes. That would help someone know where to start looking.

just installed it. Weird i cannot reproduce it on my machine, I'm now curious what it will show up as it's only seen by one user.

Thanks for the suggestion @Kreidos

Looks like the main issue is happening here. I'm not real familiar with all those sections, but I did a little digging. Looks like there's a brief window in the zone-out -> zone-in process where the player's loc.zone is set to null. 

https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/09312396c0836f5e72fd5d8d78d731f873776c52/src/map/zone.cpp#L985-L989

My gut says the ReloadParty() code blindly referencing and calling a null loc.zone is likely causing it to crash. The window may be very small, but since that line is called once for each party member, and might fail if *either* player or leader's value is null it does strike me as a likely culprit.

I have ideas that I could try testing but that code block was added recently as part of trust changes @zach2good has been working on. He might be able to confirm/disprove my theory or have some ideas regarding a course of action.

Yup, this is pretty damming! ðŸ˜…

I have a little bit of time free today to dig through the logic here, it'd be better to fix the order of operations here rather than slap on a check to see if the zone is null.

I did some testing and unfortunately I was still able to reproduce the crash. In the crash I got, `PLeader` is null when line 755 is called.
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/a017f729cba391ca74ce8b2643269e6671b3e05b/src/map/party.cpp#L755
Far as I can tell, at L744 `PChar->PParty->members` contains only 1 member, while `info` still contains 2, causing RefreshFlags(info) to set PLeader to null when it fails to cross-check the two.

Was this fully resolved by #505 ? I can't tell from the timeline of comments and commits.

I think so
~~but I think this lack of else statement has lead to the new bug on multi-server setups where parties are not shown correctly:

no this bug is still ongoing, i have canaria currently running on gdb to get more crash logs. @Kreidos  musta have shared the memory dump along with the binary to @zach2good  this month.

I provided link over Discord DM. I can always provide again if needed just hit me up there; we've all understandably been quite busy! :)

I have the dump and the binary, but I can't gdb it because I have massive library mismatch with kain's setup. I'll keep trying to repro from scratch this week and see what I can find
