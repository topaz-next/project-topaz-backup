Adds 1 to final amount printed to the player to prevent "You must wait another 0 days to perform that action." Retail count starts at 45, not 44. 

Thanks again Nyu for the retail confirmation of count starting at 45 days on a new character. Character created just before JST Midnight showed 45 days before JST midnight and after JST midnight.

I was about to try and argue that there might be some rounding shenanigans going on here, but we're already dealing with days, so the rounding has already happened. I'm fine with the `+1`, rather than trying to dig in and find the epoch  times and `ceil` them to the next day so the maths sorts itself out üëç
