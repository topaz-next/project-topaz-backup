If you reach the skill cap that you would have at the level of the mob (example, 153 skill for A+/- at mob level 50), the client will make the skill appear as capped. However, this can happen when your level is higher than the mob's level, which will prevent gaining skills even if you fight higher level mobs. The workaround for it is to either zone or un/re-equip the weapon to reset it.

EDIT: disregard - I confused this with a totally different issue.
(that other issue being that DSP's cap/grades do not matching current retail)

capping isn't client side, though, if that's what you're thinking

I just saw this happen on Nasomi. Was level 10 RDM and sword capped at 19 when it should cap at 31. Dagger was at 22 uncapped. (Sword and Dagger should be the same proficiency for RDM).
Zoning uncapped my sword skill.
