Adds functionality for multiple crystal drops from a mob while in a party.  Also re-orders drops to make seals occur before crystals as is retail.  The code was tested on my server in a party of 1 to 3 people and works well.  The code was styled a tiny bit differently for topaz, so this exact code wasn't built or tested.

Closes issue #551
