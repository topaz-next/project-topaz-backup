I've just noticed that shadowbind no longer seem to work. Doing the JA does show the animation however the mob is not bound (tried multiple mob families). I am also unable to see any event in the logfiles and it seems that the mob went claimed before the animation is completed (currently the mob is coming toward me before the animation finished)

there's a few abilities that are in the process of being moved to scripts, and they won't work until then.  they are: eagle eye shot, shadowbind, phantom rolls, wild card, part of mijin gakure, DRG jumps, accomplice/collaborator, snarl, gauge and reward
