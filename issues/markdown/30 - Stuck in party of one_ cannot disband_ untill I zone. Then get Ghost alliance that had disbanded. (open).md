----

Logged in to help someone. Formed part. Other party alliances my party. Alliance had 2 partial parties before this. After killing thing, alliance leader changes zones (and his new zone is on a different map server, just FYI) alliance disbands, and my party members leaves. I am in a party of one (normal). I go to disband my party of one..Game ignores me.

Nothings special had occurred, nothing out of the ordinary, before this point. No errors in server console or log. I change zones...suddenly my party is in alliance again. The one that disbanded. At this point I was able to dissolve alliance and then disband my party.

i only touched search/level sync :D

(not that i bothered to take a proper look yet, but i dont think this one can be fixed outside of rewriting how parties/alliances are handled in zmq)
