its got nothing to do with being in docking/cargo area. rode boat several times recently, looks like a timing thing where the boats "arrival" didn't line up with when the cs event fade-out started. about 1/4 my rides did the black screen and if I afk'd an entire boat cycles sometimes it would catch up and drop me off


airships and other transports did it too (airship to kazham doing it quit often)
