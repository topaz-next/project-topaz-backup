**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:maat was resisting elemental magic even though i was capped on enf and ele and ate a puff. He resisted extremely 80% of the damaging spells. This issue is new becaustwo weeks ago i beat maat with two other chars on rdm.  Maat is working normal on other aspects, can be slept bind silenced and he hits for his normal damage, only problem is spells hit him for 20-70 damage and an occasional 100+.
