Several players from oldschool have told me that this happens from time to time. I tried it. I didn't blackscreen but I did get a message, "Another event was called..." Here's a screenie:

i wonder if this is related to players constantly getting a blackscreen hang when multiple players try to teleport at the same time within promyvion or similar zones.  i haven't yet opened an issue on it because our server is a bit out of date so i'm still waiting to test on a non-custom.

As far as the crashing clients from multiple characters zoning simultaneously, we haven't had the problem in a year or so. I would say your client is out of date. ^^ 

But this problem isn't from multiple characters zoning. It's one character zoning, and it's not happening all the time, but often.
