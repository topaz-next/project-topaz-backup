<!-- Issues will be closed without being looked into if the following information is missing (unless its not applicable). -->

**_Client Version_** (type `/ver` in game) **:**

**_Server Version_** (type `revision` in game) **:**
790e080

**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:**
master

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**
Both Radiant Breath effects (slow, silence) wear instantly (no delay in chat log between spell cast finishing and effects wearing).

Chaotic Eye (silence effect) works as expected, on same mob. Effect lasts expected amount of time (or at least doesn't wear instantly).

This behavior feels like Darkstar Issue 2009 did. Radiant Breath does light based damage in addition to the effects.
