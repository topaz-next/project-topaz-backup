If a BST charms a pet, and another mob aggroes and hits the BST, the BST's pet will attack that mob without any order from its master. I believe this behavior does not match the retail version's behavior but I don't know since I haven't played in a really long time. 

**Edit: Sorry if this is a known bug; derped on reading the "What Works" section of the wiki...

Hello. Unable to reproduce this on master as of 03/07/2020 with a charmed mob and a Called Beast one. Feel free to reopen an issue if it still happens on your end. Thank you.
