Not sure how this issue returned when it was fixed not too long ago. It can delete any effect, including things like dedication and even petrification. Also it stops charging when you zone - the charging status remains yet never fills so it can never become complete.

This is still happening as of today. It even removes Prowess and can reset XP bonus.
