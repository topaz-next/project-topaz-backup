Only one record uses a notification threshold at the moment, since as per research on the discord, it seems to vary by record and this was the only one I had confirmation on. Adding one is dead-simple and record 29 here shows how. I encourage people with retail expertise and to expand on this with any *confirmed retail values* you can obtain.
