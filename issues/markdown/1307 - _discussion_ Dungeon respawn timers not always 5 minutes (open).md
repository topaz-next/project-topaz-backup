----

I've been seeing the discussion in #1190 and #1298 regarding mob respawn timers for non-NM mobs in dungeons.

While many timers were probably reduced, it didn't happen for all mobs across the board. For example,  the [FFXIclopedia page for the fomor in Phomiuna Aqeducts is still accurate at 14m](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Fomor_Dark_Knight).

Below are video links, with timestamp links, from when I was running around there for COP missions and farming keys. I was the only person in the zone (joy of being on Leviathan).

Lunette blowing up set of fomor (Ranger, Dark Knight, Samurai, Ninja) at E-5, at 21:55:30 (my time)

I decided to pull Hana in for TH, this is her running around _not_ killing things:

5 minutes and 15 seconds (check Youtube time indexes in links) before. ..
(Feel free to hit the left key a few times to see that she really was lost at least 6 minutes prior to below)

Hana seeing the same group of fomor at E-5 popping at 22:33:00 (my time)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RO6skmk7mg&t=1h2m25s

She had been waiting there for at least 2 minutes prior to them popping:

Unfortunately, while I hadn't put Hana on-video yet, here's the video ~14 minutes prior to the above group spawning, with her killing a Ninja, Samurai, Monk, and two others (at 22:18:00 my time). While she's not on video during the kills, the loot messages show it's the same group, as only one group of fomor has that setup across [map 1](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ffxi/images/3/38/Phomiuna-aqueducts_2_NM.png/revision/latest?cb=20091224085826) and [map 2](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/ffxi/images/0/0b/Phomiuna-aqueducts_3_NM.png/revision/latest?cb=20091224090812):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RO6skmk7mg&t=47m55s

I'm not making any claims to any mobs in any previous PRs. Just want to illustrate that there's _not_ a universal rule of 5 minute respawns for all non-NM mobs in dungeons.

I think for everyone's sanity going forwards, we should probably spot-check a bunch of these mobs on retail to confirm "5-mins-or-not". I've got some time, I'll check some of them today.

Until now i have done a few mobs in each zone where i submitted the 5 min change.
So far so good but I will stay on alert going forward, especially for those "kind of mission" dungeons..

Ok in fact Phomunia Aqueduct is not a Ground of Valor dungeons, that's probably why.
I am only doing GoV dungeons.
