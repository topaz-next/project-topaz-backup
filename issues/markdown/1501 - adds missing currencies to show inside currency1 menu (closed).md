_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1501_

----

Adds missing currencies inside Currency1 in both packet and sql db as of 10NOV2020
Also added migration script for existing servers to add those columns

Didn't add daily tally to the import as it already exists as a different file, but not for the sql import script or found in the currency1.cpp packet

This should help new members freaking out about having random numbers on their currencies. I will work on currency2 on an upcoming PR.
