_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 587_

----

Topaz lacked a really good way of controlling Gil payouts for those who don't like adding Gil to every single mob kill. This PR adds a modifier for the naturally-dropped Gil amounts. This multiplier does not apply to the gil from *all_mobs_gil_bonus*, only the normally-dropped amounts.

This combined with the all_mobs_gil_bonus affords much needed economic flexibility, including the option to set it to 0 and tweak all_mobs_gil_bonus to offer flat per-level Gil payouts server-wide.
