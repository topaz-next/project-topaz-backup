â€¦igress Strikes

-- Usage of CS ID 135 here doesn't allow onEventFinish portion of script to fire off and add quest The Tigress Strikes.
---- This subsequently causes NPC Rotih Moalghett in Fort Karugo Narugo [S] to not update a variable needed to proceed further and then the snowball starts forming...
-- CS ID 135 appears to just be dialogue that is used as part of the dialogue of CS ID 133.
-- No snowballs were harmed in this submission.
