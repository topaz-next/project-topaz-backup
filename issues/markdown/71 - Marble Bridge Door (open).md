The current Marble Bridge door doesn't work as intended. 
Tested this and it will currently only open to San'dOrian's if you haven't completed the Mission "Dawn". If you have completed the Mission and are San'dOrian it will not open. The file is also called _6s1.lua?

Hi, 
Yes : the door is triggered in several cs, in  order for those to work (laloff amphiteatre door in AA cs etc) correctly in cs (open for player), the right name is needed.
For the script there's  several thing missing, the announcement of which race /sex is allowed to enter displayed in upper jeuno availability for all once cop is finished...

Is there a way to grab a player's race/gender from Lua? I didn't see that.
