**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
Automaton weaponskills cannot trigger skillchain effects. (example: Back Hand Blow > Cannibal Blade should make Gravitation. This does not occur.) Automatons also do not always use the weaponskill they should when following up with inhibitor equipped, resulting in them using strongest weapon instead. (example: Back Hand Blow should cause automaton to use Cannibal Blade. If it is unable to create a skillchain or owner's tp is less than 90%, automaton will instead use strongest ws ~Chimera Ripper @75 capped skills~)
