Other characters should not be visible by the person viewing any opening nation cutscene.

I've noticed that these cutscenes have been turned off by default as a potentially short term fix, that has now lasted over the course of a few years now.

Has there been a fix implemented for this or is this still being worked on? I'm a bit confused as the reply with a similar issue has been closed. 

I've asked the individual server I've joined to enable them but I was also directed to ask here as well but I've come across this thread and didn't want to open a new issue considering it's already here. Perhaps we could re-enable these by default and those with cutscene skipping plugins/addons can just skip them if they'd prefer to do so?

rhomagus I think they've just always been default off back before they ever worked, and nobody ever enabled them after the major issues had been resolved (this issue we are commenting in is the only remaining one I am aware of at this time)

Individual servers have always had the ability to choose to turn them on. Either they were not aware they work, never noticed the setting, or intentionally chose to leave them off.

I guess this is true for all CS? I was with the fiance doing my WAR armour quest and was able to see his character when on the CS to receive the armour lol. Maybe SE sends a package to disable showing all other PCs that are on, then re-enables it once the CS is over? Or maybe just stops sending all PCs packets, who knows lolüê±

Might be that last bit: they just don‚Äôt get those packets during cs
