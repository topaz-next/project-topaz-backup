_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 561_

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

If I open a WIP PR, maybe it'll shame me into finishing this chunk of work so it can be merged into canary ðŸ‘€ 

UPDATE: I've filled in the missing moves and the bosses are starting to feel a bit more right. They will at least not sit around like potatoes doing 0 damage all the time. 

It looks like some of the animations are missing/wrong (but nothing is borked), so as work item for me later is to get more caps of these fights so I can fix them.

Actually, does Siren have a spell list?
