The only thing missing is that the whole family of these mobs does not go into their shell like they are supposed to. It makes the BC a little easier than it should be but what can you do? Someone should make that mixin.

Rebased with Release and fixed the spell_list conflict created by adding the Puddings since submitting.

There is a very handy mixin you can copy/steal/appropriate that handles mobs going into a shell:

EDIT: On closer inspection, this fight is Uragnites, the mixin is Uragnites... sounds like a match to me!

Merged into `feature/enm` and shifted around all the SQL required. Gonna open an issue for adding the Urganite mixin to the mobs. Thanks for the ENM!
