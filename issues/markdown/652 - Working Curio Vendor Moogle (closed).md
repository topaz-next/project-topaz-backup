_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 652_

----

Added all shop items (except keyitems) for all curio moogles (UP to RHAPSODIES IN AZURE as the other quests have not been scripted, but should be easy to just populate with correct information once they are)
Made it a global to not have to have those scripts all over the place.
Thank you Hiro from the Canaria server for testing and making sure that the prices and order was correct.
