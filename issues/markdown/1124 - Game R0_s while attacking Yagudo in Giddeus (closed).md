**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
Attacking any Yagudo in Giddeus causes the game client to r0. I can engage from a distance but when i should swing the game client r0's. We discussed a possible issue with howl. Nyu claims the Quadav in Palborough also cause a r0 in the same mannor but i have not tested it myself. Attacking Yagudo in Sarutabaruta do NOT cause an r0
