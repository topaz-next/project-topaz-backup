You can retrieve 47 or 49, but not 48 crystals. The dialogue indicates you should be receiving it, but the moogle does not give the player the Clusters, nor does their stock of that type of crystal get reduced in the database. The same goes for each that results in a cluster quantity multiple of 4. 4, 8, 12, etc.
