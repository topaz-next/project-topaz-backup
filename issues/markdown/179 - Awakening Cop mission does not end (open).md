This only ends once you complete CoP and  Apoc. Nigh.. will then change both CoP and ZM to The Last Verse..  Also awakening is a ZM mission not a CoP mission as stated in title.. As for achieving this point within the mission storyline? Will probably prove difficult since i do not think DSP has Apoc. Nigh coded..
