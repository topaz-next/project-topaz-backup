_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1365_

----

**DON'T PANIC**

Most servers have had these fixes for 12 or so days. If you're a server operator who wasn't previously aware of this, you need to contact me on Discord.

We were very kindly donated a list of common exploits that can be used to crash a server, warp around freely, cheese craft attempts etc. We've been working on patching these, and this is the first part - **the ones easiest for a bad actor to achieve**. These are all reproduced, and then verified fixed.

_The crashes can be forced on a server with a single operation from either of the two common windowing programs._
 
Any questions -> Discord.

EDIT: Before I merge I'll swap out the `ShowWarning` for `ShowExploit`
