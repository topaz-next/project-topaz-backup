_edit: that link may take a long time to load. its one of the earliest commits to the repository, and was a lot of junk at once_

that doesn't work anymore, looks like its only firing for items that are usable, used to run on every item (which was bad behavior anyway?)

other: 
1. Missing the return.
2. That should be a mod to generically add a spell anyway in case SE ever adds another item granting a spell.. with a safety check to see if the player already has the spell native (the above script would remove it even if player had it without the equip, if the script was working)

it's supposed to run on any item with the script flag set as a response to
certain things.  Twilight Cloak does have SCRIPT_EQUIP set, but since we
just got another bug saying the dusk/dawn part of NIN AF isn't working
(which uses the same flag) then there might be something wrong with the
actual Lua call

Unrelated, the haste was just getting floored to 0% after being missed in the haste rewrite.
