This also applies to the Paralyze effect on Tachi: Kasha.

In retail you actually _can_ land a gekko silence on some of the mobs that you cannot land the spell silence on without extreme difficulty/circumstances. I think thats because it's bypassing part of the resist math used for spells since it isn't one (their meva ?) rather than bypassing true immunity though, so pretty sure still something to fix here, just thought I'd mention that it doesn't work exactly the same.

Teo, do you have any sources for that? From my 11 years playing on 
retail, I don't recall a single monster you can silence using Gekko 
where the monster has native silence immunity. This includes regular 
monsters, aswell as HNM and NM. Looking forward to information on that.

In addition, Gekko has no resist calculation /at all/. The duration of 
Gekko's silence is at minimum reduced by checking resistence, and if a 
monster is immune - it's immune.

"In retail you actually can land a gekko silence on some of the mobs that you cannot land the spell silence on"

Would imply if you cannot land silence, then the mob is immune (as that is the very definition). If I misread it, then I apologise. 

Either way; resistant mobs should see Gekko's silence duration reduced; and immunity should be just that.

.."rather than bypassing true immunity though, so pretty sure still something to fix here, just thought I'd mention that it doesn't work exactly the same." Is ~~implying~~ _actually saying_ I didn't at all think it was bypassing immunity on retail.

"Cannot land" and being "immune" aren't the same thing. Things you could never ever land a spell on back in 2004 because of massive resistance even with max +enfeeble skill and ele seal can now nailed from greatly increased macc from newer gear or simply by repeat casts eroding their resistance, but were never truly immune. Hence my use of the phrasing "cannot land". I have edited my previous comment to try and prevent further misunderstanding next time someone reads this.

"cannot land the spell silence on without extreme difficulty/circumstances." Good enough?

re: Tachi: Kasha - the para proc rate is also absurdly powerful (25%). Compare it to the tested para proc rate of Blade: Metsu at 10%.

can anyone verify that the WS will apply the effect if the mob is actually _immune_ on DSP? looking at the code it should not

It does not. I used Shockwave on a Hecteyes that was immune to sleep and it didn't sleep it.

hozu shockwave is kind of borked last I knew, fails to sleep mobs because its own damage wakes them in the same action.

Oh really? That's slightly amusing. Uh, let me think... I believe that using Tachi: Gekko on Gotoh Dha the Redolent doesn't silence it, since it's set to have silence immunity.

Weaponskills that add status effects should be using the `applyResistance` methods. Someones gonna have to go through all the skills and fix them. I think a new `applyResistance` just for weapon skills might have to be made as well.
