I looked into this and I couldn't figure out why it's broken. It looks like it should work, but it doesn't. Then again, I'm not very good at coding so I clearly missed something.

And yeah, this is broken on a stock DSP server.

It doesn't work because I don't know which packet to put the blue points in.  I don't play blue mage on retail (not even unlocked) so it's not readily available for me to find out.  If you skip the client side checks for setting spells (using an addon) it will work as expected
