1. Die
2. Raise or reraise
3. Get hit with a charm move like Gala Macabre (its AoE) before your animation completes
4 Grats, you are now a forever charmed corpse with HP. You will remain on the ground but follow your master (he'll drag the body around) **and charm will never wear off.**

**Additional issue with charm:** 
Other players who were charmed but not stuck between life and death were completely unable to claim the mob after their charm effect wore off.
