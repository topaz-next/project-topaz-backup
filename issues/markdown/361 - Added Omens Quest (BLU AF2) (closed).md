_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 361_

----

Changed BEGINNINGS to check correct AF1 global
Position of flans not accurate to retail as there's no captures for a full alliance fighting BCNM
renamed blank npc to Blu_Af2 so it's easier to tell what purpose it serves.
Immortal Flans do not have any special AI or move sets that differences them from other flans.
Thank you @Wiggo32  for capturing this quest.
