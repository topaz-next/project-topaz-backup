~~don't try and do the proc system on melee yet please. will talk to you on discord.~~

the other stuff, TH on SA/TA/fient/whatever, go ahead

~~I've got the melee stuff handled in a branch I need to finish~~
*UPDATE* : Passed him what was in my other branch so he can ger'r'done if he wants to, will pull his changes into my branch and resolve conflicts after if I need to.

edit:
>[9:08 PM] nfaletra: so TH procs still apply on the first normal swing or first hit of a weaponskill (no msg for ws).
>[9:09 PM] nfaletra: SA, TA, Feint just increase the chance it applies.
>[9:09 PM] nfaletra: so I guess it all needs to wait for your stuff.
>[9:09 PM] nfaletra: however, I can at least add evasion down effect to Feint
>[9:09 PM] nfaletra: cause that was never done.
>[9:09 PM] Teo: oh..
>[9:09 PM] Teo: copy pasting our convo to github den so nobody else tries

do we really need the "old" way? isn't it just.. the same as the current way, without the procs?

pretty much. I was planning to just point out an on/off for the melee procs.

sounds easy enough to have an on/off for the proc, since i guess it's mostly in one spot anyways
