Now that the order of operations has been cleaned up for spells,
Pinecone Bomb can be properly implemented. It does damage to the mob
(which may wake it up from a previous slept state), but then can reapply
sleep as described here: https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pinecone_Bomb

Hello, @mrhappyasthma! Thank you for contributing to Project Topaz!

So that we don't use our parent project's brand, we've changed some function and table names to reflect adopting a new brand. I remember seeing that this PR was started prior to Topaz and originally submitted to our parent project - I took the liberty of updating these references for you; you don't need to sweat over them!

Although, I realize after I submitted the push that I should have asked first to make sure I didn't step on your toes. I'm sorry if I did! My intent was to make your contribution experience as painless as possible! ðŸ˜… 

That said, I haven't had the chance to take a look at the code yet. We try to be relatively swift with reviews though, so I look forward to working with you soon!

Question: Do you want me squashing these commits? Or do the mergers handle that for this repo?

Rebased and closed out some of the outstanding comments.

This PR is still waiting on a more accurate TP-based sleep duration.

Corrected the attackType to be `RANGED`.

Still need to do a bit of research for the TP-based sleep. Been crazy with work and will be having more travel over the coming weeks. Whenever I can find some downtime I can plot some of the values from the captures and find a reasonable equation.

Compiled a spreadsheet from the two captures in which Chain Affinity was used:

BTW I still haven't forgotten about this. Just a crazy time we live in these days... Whenever I get some time I'll dig into those spreadsheets and compile any other data that is needed.

Wow thanks for digging so deeply into this. I know my contributions have been sporadic and irregular. So I really appreciate you doing all this work on behalf of this PR.
