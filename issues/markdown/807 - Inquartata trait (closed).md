@Apocarypse @cocosolos @ibm2431 modifiers in modifier.h and statsu.lua should mirror each other until such time as lua can automagically use the core enums, even if the mod is never used in script so that future editor don't mistakenly use the same ID - this has happened multiple times in the older project history until I became its watchdog in dsp.
