<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

For Sandy Mission "Ranperre's Final Rest", Which is mission 6-2 it is currently coded it looks like to wait 1 day. It use to be wait 1 Japanese midnight, but the most current guides state it just requires a zone. 

Can we change the OS wait to a need zone true? 

Thank you!
