If we listen to what wiki's say, this might require some retail research, [on the tractor page](http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Tractor):

`Tractor does not work in some BCNMs.`

So we should:

- Verify if this is even true.
- If true, determine a list of BCNMs that you can/can't tractor.
- Enable/disable tractor based on findings.
- Fix BCNM status being reapplied based on findings.

Battlefield status being reapplied with tractor should be the exact same
process as when you log out (or disconnect) in a BCNM and log back.  If
one's broken, the other may be as well

As far as I know, tractor is available in any BCNM.

Tractor is not available in some BCNM's but for those of which you are not able to use it, it will simply give you a message that you cannot use it and then not allow you to cast. vs. dsp which allows you to cast and then erases your battlefield status. It would take casting tractor in every single bcnm to prove which ones allow and which ones don't but I have a theory that any battles entered using orbs (beastman/kindred seals etc..) will not allow tractor while the mission type battlefield events will. I have tested this out in 'some' battles but there are so many it will most likely take a lot of time. Regardless, when it is allowed, it should not wipe battlefield status.

This video has the "No Tractor" message as well as a player DC'ing and reconnecting to the fight:

Wiggo32 do you have the casters side of things? I didn't see the message for tractor because its the dead characters view of things in that video.
