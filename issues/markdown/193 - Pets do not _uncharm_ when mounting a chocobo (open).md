Go charm a mob... and then get on a chocobo... it'll follow you around as if you never got on the chocobo.

I don't recall them ever uncharming due to mounting in retail. I hit up people in discord and others assured me you don't lose the charmed monster upon mounting a chocobo. Any proof from retail that this now happens? (I haven't played since 2012 so it could have changed but we just need validation that it is this way in retail)
