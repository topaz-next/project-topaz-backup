<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->

**_Context::_**
Power leveling a mate. Job: RDM/SMN.
Location: West Ronfaure
Friend was fighting an Orcish Fodder. I cured him and claimed hate from the Orcish Fodder.
When the Orcish Fodder attacked me, Carbuncle (being a lovely little fox), began attacking the Orcish Fodder. This removed my friend from their instance of combat and claimed the target as my own.

on retail you CAN pull off claim steals - unfortunately SE intends it. It would be more a tug of war-though for that hate. DSP's claiming/hate mechanics aren't matching retail yet in many ways.

TeoTwawki, claiming hate is fine. That's all good. But what i'm saying it Carbuncle (and possibly other pets) have the ability to auto-engage a claimed mob and completely steal the mob from another player. I can grab a video of it if it'll help?

```
 I cured him and claimed hate from the Orcish Fodder.
```
from your own description you gained hate, if that hate were enough to do the tug of war it would be normal. do you understand what I was saying now? I'm talking about what would be ok, if it worked like it should but does not. I didn't misunderstand you - I know just being ON the hate-list should not be enough.

Hate has always been a way to [claim steal](https://youtu.be/h-5yEUHLT-k?t=215).

That entire video is worth a watch, but I time stamped the funniest moment for you.
