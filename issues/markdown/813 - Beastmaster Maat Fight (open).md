Fought Maat three times on BST, each time I encountered the same issue. I was unable to use any BST JAs once I engaged Maat and Maat's pet. Each time I tried to use Reward, Snarl, or Ready, I encountered the same error, that I could not attack, target already claimed.

Why was this closed? I didn't see it duplicated anywhere when I just looked.  This issue happens when a mob's pet is targeting your pet. It might be an issue with how the packet is set up... I haven't really looked into this one too much other than to identify and reproduce it.

I closed it as I was told by one of the GMs on SuperNova that it was our issue, because wee still arent fully integrated with Topaz.

Context: The SuperNova server is based on a version of DSP that immediately precedes the DSP merge of BCNMcrap.  On top, it's running custom BCNM code (much of which I've since added to Topaz).  So in general it's correct that BCNM-related issues from SuperNova probably shouldn't go on Topaz tracker until they're first confirmed as issues on a vanilla Topaz build.
