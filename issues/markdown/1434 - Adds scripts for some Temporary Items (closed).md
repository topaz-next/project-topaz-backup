Adds Healing Salve I/II, Clear Salve I/II, Dusty Elixir

Lowered use timers from 4s to 1s (per bg wiki, 1s use time).
Clear Salve I can remove randomly up to two effects at random (https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&u=http://wiki.ffo.jp/html/20179.html&prev=search&pto=aue). Interpreted this to mean can remove between 1 and 2 effects.
