Why's sort work for some of them and not others? Loader problem?

I am not sure on that one, it could be that the client isn't getting an
expected packet (or value in a packet) on login for the wardrobe4, or
something like that.

I think wardrobe 4 only just came out like this month on retail, so it may
have specifically not sorted because it was unable to be used until this
most recent update

it happens with the satchel to. I just supposed we sent/received something for inventory that we weren't doing for the others. I guess its a thing I can check next time retail has a free period.

Hello. I'm unable to reproduce this particular issue on canary as of 03/19/2020, sorted multiple items in the Wardrobe 4 (and the Mog Satchel) and checked if they were unsorted by zoning out of the Mog House and zoning back in, even checked through the View House menu outside the Mog House after zoning. On two different characters.  Feel free to reopen an issue if you come across something new regarding this. Thank you.

I still see this occasionally and believe it is only triggered with equipment items. I think there is a diff issue now that describes it better with a reproducible item now though so this can stay closed.
