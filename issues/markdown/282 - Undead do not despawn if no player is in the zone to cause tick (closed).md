yeah we're supposed to be checking and doing some thingies at 1st zone tick after a frozen (empty)  zone "wakes up" (somebody entered) and we currently are not.

check timers for NMs..check weather/elementals.. check undead...other things Teo can't think of right now.. we do all of this when zone is populated but only some of them when it goes empty and takes a nap and not right when it comes up from naptime.

I agree, not a huge problem by any means, but thought best to mention it.
