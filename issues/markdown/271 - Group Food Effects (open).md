**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
Group food effects don't affect multiple people. They should, and have scaling strength depending on party size.

The script for each of these foods (ie. black_curry_bun (5758)) has a TODO for the group effect.
Following discussion in github/DarkstarProject/darkstar - PR 5827, it should now be possible to start handling whole party buffs.

```
Group food effects don't affect multiple people.
```
pretty sure most of them do, https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Group_Food_Effects

for stuff that changes based on party size, I suggest using a latent if it has to change dynamically, and effect:getPower() and the like if it does not.

Latents were recently made scriptable

Ah, I meant currently in master, rather than what the expected behavior is. At least in the quick testing I did with `black_curry_bun` in a party. Thanks for the heads up about latents, I'll take a look üëç
