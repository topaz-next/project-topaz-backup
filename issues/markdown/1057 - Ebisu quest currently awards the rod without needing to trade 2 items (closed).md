**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Irmilant of Rabao powers this quest. Player is supposed to buy an expensive GP KI (Serpent Rumors, ki 1977), talk to NPC, then quest is flagged for the rod. The player then has to turn in Gugrus and Liks until they obtain items 1837 and 1826. Trade those to Irmilant and wait until next conquest tally to obtain your Ebisu rod.

As it is on all un-modified DSP and TPZ servers, just getting Serpent Rumors and talking to the NPC twice rewards the rod. Apparently, a decent number of private server players know this and never reported it for years.

Not certain if the Serpent Rumors KI should remain on the player after being granted the Ebisu rod.
