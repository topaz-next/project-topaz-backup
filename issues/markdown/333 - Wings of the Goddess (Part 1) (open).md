----

This issue will be used to track overall progress for our current [Project Focus](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/wiki/Project-Focus) for Story Content - [Wings of the Goddess (Part 1)](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/projects/3).

As items are completed, they will be checked off the list. When all sub-items for a quest or mission are completed, that item will be checked off, and the sub-items deleted from the list.

Issues regarding bugs, inaccuracies, or incomplete progress in relation to these items (when any amount of progress has been made on the item), should be discussed in a new, separate issue.

When sharing captures, be mindful that some people may not want their violations of FFXI's Terms of Service publicly viewable on the open internet to everyone who finds our GitHub repository. Please only share links to captures over Discord.

As always, please remember that it is easier and quicker to review smaller Pull Requests than larger Pull Requests.
