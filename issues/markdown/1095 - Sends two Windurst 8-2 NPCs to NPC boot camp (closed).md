I also want to mention that his 4 different general dialogue options are educated guesses on exactly when he begins saying them.

169 warns the player not to reveal anything about the book of the gods to anyone, which obviously makes sense following his warning of that same thing at the end of mission 2-1.

Once you've dealt with the book being blank in 7-1, it'd make sense that his dialogue would change, but not back to 370... so 379 was the most likely candidate.

Then for event 380, I placed it after windurst mission 10 because he speaks of the nightmare (referring to the shadow lord and book of the gods) ending thanks to the adventurer.

Open for input or testing to get these events 100% for him.
