_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 352_

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Simply put, BST can't use the ability [Bestial Loyalty](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Bestial_Loyalty) - there is no ability script for it.

For implementation, it should be roughly the same as [Call Beast](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/scripts/globals/abilities/call_beast.lua) - just don't consume the Jug.

Will be partially implemented by #343 

After that PR, the ability still needs to be added to SQL.
