Meriting Katana combat skill causes Blade: Yu appear in the weapon skill menu (and is usable on level 75 nin) when over 290 skilll having only enabled expansions up to WOTG enabled and content restricted via config. This ws unlocked at level 80 - didn't level cap increase from 75 when Abyssea came out?

if on an oldschool capped server, the owner needs to edit their ws table as we have no setting to prevent modern ws from popping up if they are gained via skill. its a really simple one time edit.

okay thanks

As i'm testing this further, i tried SAM at 75, merited enough GKT skill to have 304 GKT. Tachi: Ageha appears in the ws list... but disappears immediately when i exit the mog house and doesn't appear anymore when i re-enter the mog house... something weird is happening ;)

Ok i equipped a Yoichinoyumi and suddendly Ageha appeared again right before Namas Arrow on the list :D
