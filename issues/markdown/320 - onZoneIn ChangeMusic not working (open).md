Music for xmas in jeuno area not working, there is nothing wrong in the logic, ChangeMusic is just not working when inside onZoneIn.

Tried placing the ChangeMusic inside afterZoneIn function, but this will make the song repeat itself which is really annoying.

> [12:51 PM] TÄ“o: changeMusic used to work from onZoneIn just fine I dunno what change broke that. when I have time I'm going to make something that acts on the zone instead of the player to facilitate this.

on the upside, this will be taken care of after I finish making the functionality to change music of the zone object itself instead if overwriting it with a packet sent to player's client :+1: then we just check the date and zone itself gets changed and any server zoning into it already has correct music. (this is more accurate to what retail actually does too)
