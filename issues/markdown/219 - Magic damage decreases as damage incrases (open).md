I hit a Robber Crab in Teriggan with Thunder for 155. I ate an Apple Pie. The damage actually went down.

I went for another Robber Crab to test. I hit Thunder for 141 damage. Took two +2 INT rings off. The damage went up to 149. I am RDM 66 with Moldavite Earring, so I have MAB +29.

Edit: More testing and saw the damage went up. Not sure if this was specific to food or not, or a quirky resist.
