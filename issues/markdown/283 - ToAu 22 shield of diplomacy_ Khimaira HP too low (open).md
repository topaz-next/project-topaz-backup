None of the wikis show the HP, so that could be a problem.
Perhaps if someone can get an estimate based on retail, we could adjust, but without having a value, no clue how to fix it. From what I see here though, http://spiritangel.catsboard.com/t892-mission-22-shield-of-diplomacy it looks like it should be close to 30k HP.
The NPC issue will take some ai-ing...
