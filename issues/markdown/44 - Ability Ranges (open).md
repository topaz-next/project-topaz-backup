Ability ranges for SMN and BST have changed. However, I'm not quite sure what's going on in ability.sql for the ranges. They appear to be in yalms, but I know I cannot do most of the BPs listed as 18 yalms from 18 yalms away - it's more like 15. Here's the list of update ranges: github/Windower/Resources/commit/69f92085b8cd294709a550b8183bbdad7bb8d5ec?diff=splitDarkstar Issue diff-2efd76d3bf1dc039953c2015cfca0d8aL79

Actually appears the values in the tables are yalms and I was mistaken. The new values still need to be added though.
