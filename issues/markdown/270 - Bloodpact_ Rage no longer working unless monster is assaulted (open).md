**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Bloodpacts no longer work unless the monster is assaulted. The behavior I have been used to seeing is if you are within 15 yalms (pet to mob, not player to mob), then you can bloodpact:rage pre-emptively to get a little more damage in before you start a fight. This has recently stopped working on my server, but if I recall correctly, the behavior I mention above is consistent with what retail was.
