**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Issue noticed on server Dawnbreak, was guided to this github to enter an issue about it.

I tried fishing in multiple zones with multiple types of baits and I was only able to catch "trash" items such as Rusty Leggings, Copper Rings and Rusty Buckets.

I am aware that skill-up isn't implemented right now (https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/168), but I was informed that a workaround was that players were considered max level and would be able to fish any fish as long as they have the right bait at the right spot.

N.B. I also noticed it takes more than 10 arrow clicks in the "mini-game" to fish once, which is a lot for "trash" items.

Have a good day!

It depends on a lot of factors, a few fish are catchable most are not :( its broken in several ways as “craft skill”. In addition to most of the fish never biting your line and skillups bot happening, I am pretty sure skill isn’t used either atm.
