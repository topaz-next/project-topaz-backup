Tested abilities on the deoffset abilities. recreated sql to have offset. more information is in the deoffset list which i have saved for when ever that is pushed to branches. I have tested these in game only issues ive come across are with a few of the animations. May want to create or pull into a testing branch incase my server missed something.

I'm gonna put a hold tag on this until I can sit down and give this a really thorough review. This is good stuff, there's just loads of it.

I spent 30 minutes looking over this PR last night and I barely feel I've scratched the surface lol

Specifically _because_ this is such a massive PR, I would ask you to set up your editor to honour our editorconfig file (https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/.editorconfig).

If you're like me and you edit your Lua in VSCode, `Lua Helper` formats everything nicely (I'm not sure if it's using the editorconfig file, but the output looks good).

This'll handle: spacing out args, newline at end of file, indentation, etc. etc. etc.

I'm not gonna comment on style until you've ran a tool over everything, because I'm a human and I'll let mistakes through!

I grabbed a styling tool and ran it over all my changes. Looks good now thanks, I had no idea there was one and it makes life much easier!

I still need to check everywhere for extra sets of parens where they aren't needed.

I checked all of the comments at the top and adjusted where necessary.

I don't really like DNC part either I went thru what was already scripted for flourish n step abilities to get them to do what they should. They test ok in game just still trying to get animations found.

I think I took care of all the extra sets of parens where they aren't needed

I've sat down and done about 5 partial reviews of this this week, and I think it's totally fair to drop this into a feature branch and into canary since it's 99.9% additive. It isn't going to break anything that wasn't already broken üëç 

Thanks for the gargantuan effort!
