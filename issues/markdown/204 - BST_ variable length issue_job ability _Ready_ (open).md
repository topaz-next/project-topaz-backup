I was not able to reproduce this on any BST level with jug pets.  Are there any straightforward steps that allowed you to get to this point?

No, unfortunately I was not able to reproduce either.

We had seen this with Quick draw as well, because they are both abilities
with charges. Maybe stratagems too, but nobody ever reported that one.

We addressed negative charges awhile back to avoid this exact issue.

Still seeing it. And can never repro on a local copy, only on a crowded server with 100+ ppl doing things.

We did?

github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/commit/f06d28f70e28a00606da4b17cb65d64be6a8a610 - Was related to shared recast of sic/ready and was able to get negative values at the time, but maybe I'm wrong here.

I was in a party with MoguSN as a BST75 and I could not reproduce. He used several jugs and they all had that number which is remarkably close to a 16bit signed INT size (65535). After /shutdown (not /logout) the issue vanished. We also had another BST51 there that could not reproduce it either.
