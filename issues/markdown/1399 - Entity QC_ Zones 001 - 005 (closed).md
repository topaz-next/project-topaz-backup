Some mob and npc QC for zones 001 - 005.  Compared what's in our DB against Nyu's retail captures.

Of note, several of our ??? NPCs were mixed up compared to retail, id-vs-position-wise.  In this PR I have corrected the QM positions, and also changed the names from qm# to something that describe what the QM does/spawns, such as qm_cryptonberries.  Numerically-ordered QMs fail when SE moves, adds, and removes NPCs.
