<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
Several issues with this mission BCNM:
- you pop very close to the Lamias
- you cannot call trusts
- you need to defeat more than 3 Lamias to succeed
- When winning, got stuck in a black screen instead of the winning cutscene
  (could be a transient issue there)
