Last time I played Summoner on retail this wasn't the case. Say if my avatar is Assaulting a mob, I use a BP Rage Ability, and the mob goes out of range for the attack, It uses the mp that the BP Rage would have used. 

I feel that the BP Rage only uses MP if the attack connects. I'm not sure if this is current retail behaviour. When I played Summoner during WotG and Abyssea this wasn't retail behaviour.

Uh that's how I remember it working. If the mob gets stunned and such, still eats your mp.

nesstea that's how it used to be long ago. Late 75 era it was changed to only consume MP on successful BP use.

Similarly, DRG wyverns only consume TP on a successful breath, apparently (many DRGs tell me they would use Spirit Link immediately after using a WS to take TP from their Wyvern to do a self skillchain).

Ok so, on stun it uses MP, but if the mob goes out of range it doesn't use MP. If I remember correctly.
