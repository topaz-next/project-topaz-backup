Implements the retrace spell into the game, along with related usable items:
- Scroll of Instant Retrace
- Cobra staff
- Fourth staff
- Ram staff

The staves have separate teleport IDs from Retrace because you can use their teleports after joining a different allied nation.

Retrace was changed from an 8 second cast to a 5 second cast recently according to wiki so I adjusted that.
