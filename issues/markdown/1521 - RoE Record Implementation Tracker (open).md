I'll try to keep this list updated and note sections which already have someone working on them. A checkmark on a category means that section is 100% complete; Otherwise, a rough percentage will be noted next to each if some are done.

Please contact me before starting work on a category, as there are a few persons already undertaking them, and I'd hate your hard work be for naught when someone else PRs it first.

Bastok, San d'Oria, and Windurst missions are implemented on a local branch.  Testing now, and if anyone could suggest a faster way than running through manually I'd be greatly appreciative.  !add/completemission seems to fail a lot in many cases.
