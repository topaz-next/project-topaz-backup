**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:**
master

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**
If Leave is used in the pets home area, it will just start roaming right after using the ability
if it's used outside the home area, it will immediately despawn

on retail there was a delay before roaming/despawning that could be used to recharm the pet (to reset the charm duration)
