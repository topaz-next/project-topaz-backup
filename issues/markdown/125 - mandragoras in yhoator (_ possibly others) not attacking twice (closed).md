Did some quick debugging; these particular mob's main hand is set to Scythe instead of H2H.

I notice all the mandragora are set to scythe. iirc they were set to that because of delay issues?

I set the mainhand of the Yhoator mandy to H2H in the sql and left the cmbDelay alone; everything seems fine to me.
Used : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFqktcqvIuE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFqktcqvIuE) as a reference for attack speed.

I can update the mandys to H2H if there aren't other issues i'm not aware of.

Not yet; I'll take care of it tonight. I was holding off in case there was any reasons against me making the changes. Sounds like there are none. :)

Update:
I think I'm going to make this a part of a larger Mandragora Family fix. Going through the DB, I'm seeing other issues like incorrect jobs and missing spell lists for certain NMs in the mandragora family.
