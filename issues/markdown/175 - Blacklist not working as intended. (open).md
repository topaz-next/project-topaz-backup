So some idiots finally gave people cause to actually use the blacklist function in game on a private server..the entries appear to be saved to the database correctly but their chat still gets through. Not sure why, because a second bug implies the filtering does work: Someone blacklisted *themselves* which should not be possible but the current implementation allows it. This resulting in their character being unable to use any `` commands.

IsBlacklisted isn't referenced anywhere but when adding/removing, so it
seems like it was never implemented.

That makes the self blacklist thing even more crazy - client doesn't stop you, but does self censor the chat?!

It looks like the client handles it, and the problem may be relating to zoning and the b-list packet being re-sent. Since I'm about out of bandwidth already (retarded throttle to below dialup speed, even dc's me from chat) I've contracted a few guinea-pigs to test that theory further.

Its the size. Need a packet cap from someone with a larger number of names in their blacklist on retail.

> When I coded blacklist for DSP I had no way to test against 100+ names to see how retail handled multiple packets for the blacklist since it is sent as part of the zone-in packet to stop downloading. See here:
github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/blob/master/src/map/packets/stop_downloading.cpp

says guy who did the original implementation of it.
