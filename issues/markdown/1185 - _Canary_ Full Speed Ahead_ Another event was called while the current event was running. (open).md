**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

When retrying the course (after failing once) a cutscene will interrupt the completion CS when you succeed.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Flag quest, run the course, fail the course, and retry at same difficulty
2. Complete full speed ahead course and speak with Syrillia.
3. Success cutscene will start.
4. After "Have a safe journey back!" an error will appear "Another event was called while current event was running."
5. Client is stuck in blackscreen and unable to log out "You cannot use that command while mounted".
6. Force quitting client
7. Log back in
8. Syrilla has no dialog
9. Trek back to Jeuno
10. Mapitoto presents "Ride the raptor?" dialog when speaking to her.

Additional Notes:

After accepting the steps for "Ride the raptor? dialog with Mapitoto (after step 10 above) and completing the course successfully without failing (again) the quest will successfully complete.
