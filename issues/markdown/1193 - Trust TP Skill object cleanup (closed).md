Remove this horrible broken object:
```lua
mob:setTPSkills({
        ['skills'] = {
            { ai.r.WS, tpz.ws.BURNING_BLADE, 0 },
            { ai.r.WS, tpz.ws.RED_LOTUS_BLADE, 0 },
            { ai.r.WS, tpz.ws.VORPAL_BLADE, 60 },
        },
        ['mode'] = ai.tp.ASAP,
        ['skill_select'] = ai.s.RANDOM,
    })
```

Replace with a db-based mob skill list and this simple binding:
```sql
INSERT INTO `mob_skill_lists` VALUES ('TRUST_Naji',1012,33); -- Burning Blade
INSERT INTO `mob_skill_lists` VALUES ('TRUST_Naji',1012,34); -- Red Lotus Blade
INSERT INTO `mob_skill_lists` VALUES ('TRUST_Naji',1012,40); -- Vorpal Blade
```
```lua
mob:setTrustTPSkillSettings(ai.tp.ASAP, ai.s.RANDOM)
```
The binding will default to `ai.tp.ASAP, ai.s.RANDOM` behaviour if not provided, so it isn't present in simple trusts.

Added bonus: All the trust skill list numbers are reserved in `release`, so no conflicts!

Also removes a good amount of wacky Lua stack and table shenanigans, so if the stack overflows were from me... this should fix it. But we still don't know the cause for sure ðŸ¤· 

This update sponsored by Maat - who has his own animations, so can't have all of his WSs yet.

Since this is targetting `feature/trust`, I'm going to merge it in right away - because `feature/trust` is getting a bit far behind and I still have to merge `release` into it :(

EDIT: Also, it removes _horror_ and adds some potential stability fixes, so there's no reason no to!
