2nd form shadow lord goes down too easy. 1st form is just right but 2nd form is just too easy.

that's kinda vague kain.. not enough hp, takes higher dmg than expected, doesn't hard enough.. gives us something to go on.

it doesnt match the difficulty with its first form, it either has not too much HP or it takes too much magic damage >.<

Either that or it should be that easy and the first form is too difficult lol but TBH i like the 1st form.
