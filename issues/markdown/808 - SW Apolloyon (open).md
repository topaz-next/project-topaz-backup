**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Issue 1

When entering with more than one person the everyone but the first person entering is not able to use magic or weaponskills.  The play is not getting completely registered to the instance. The player will receive the message "You cannot enter Limbus at present, please wait a little longer" as they get moved to zone.  

If the player then uses a gmcommand to force warp to them self the instance seems to get added and everything starts to work as it should.


Issue 2

On elemental floor all the elementals link the entire zone.  Elements should only link same type.
