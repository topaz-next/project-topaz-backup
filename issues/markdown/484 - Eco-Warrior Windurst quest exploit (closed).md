**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

After following the quest as intended and receiving the KI from the ??? after killing flies, if you warp and directly talk to Lumomo for your reward instead of Ahko, your char variable for having killed the NMs never resets, so next week you do this you will just keep getting the KI without having to fight.  We fixed this on our end by moving player:setCharVar("ECOR_WAR_WIN-NMs_killed", 0) from Ahko to Lumomo when you receive the reward.
