I'll use this issue to track battlefield TODOs as I work my way through adding our stuff to DSP.  If anyone fixes any of these points, please reference this issue and I'll keep this list up-to-date.

[The complete spreadsheet where I'm keeping track of stuff](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W7bI0oqhhZHLGves8W21-QmPd2aM5Z-GmzsIeBPMX30)
