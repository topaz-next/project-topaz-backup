_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1453_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

This PR will go unnoticed by all except those that use a separate machine for the DB and Server Client. 
From my testing (MariaDB on AWS, Server Client on local machine at home) I've found that DB's hosted separately will sever TCP/IP read and writes if they are silent for more than 2 hours. 

This change should mean Server Client and DB will work "Out of the box" when hosted on separate machines.

Haha, I've sorted it. Commit message was automatically used as PR title

We were aiming for you to amend and overwrite your original commit, instead of adding 2 over the top of it ;)
I've taken your first commit as a patch and pushed it into release: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/commit/8573c78f9a67744da0893feeaef9ef9cca9c7d66
