From the title of the PR, this seems to do two different things but it has one commit only. I would recommend breaking these two changes into two different commits. One for fixing the respawn timers and another for adding back the mousses. This way it is easier to see in steps "okay, this part is just the respawns, and this part is adding the mouses back." Instead of it all being mixed in together, I hope that makes sense.

apologies, got lost as to what was going on here. looks like drop list id just needs to be changed as something else was merged in prior. if you can update the id and change the mob group assignment, i'll merge this in asap @jarmengaud
