Randomly or always when they do a certain move? Was the mob's skill being interrupted in any way?(running out of its range counts, as does any form of stun)

It was totally random. sometimes it did the screwdriver animation properly, but the next time it was that crazy thing in the image. Nothing was interrupted or out of range or anything unusual.

Looks like you are right GMYasiinEra - the ws started but never happened before he died. Maybe the "cancel ws" logic is messed up globally?

Defeated a Clipper in Korroloka while it was using Metallic Body. It did a "zzzzz" animation as if it was getting slept. Revision c79a3f2 on oldschool.
