_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 434_

----

Adds a function to load vectors full of obtainable item ids from each mystery box dial on map init. Adds a function to select a random item id from one of those vectors, using the dial number as an argument. Updated Arbitrix to use this function and give out items, and hold onto an item until collected by the player when inventory is full.
