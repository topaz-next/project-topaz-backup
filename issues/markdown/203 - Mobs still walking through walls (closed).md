Hello. Since this one is not particularly documented beside a screenshot and is a duplicate of a bunch of similar Navmeshes issues (https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/68, https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/89, https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/97, https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/98, https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/147, etc.), I'm going to close it for now. Thank you.
