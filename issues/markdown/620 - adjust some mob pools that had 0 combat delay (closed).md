I did a search for mob pools with 0 cmbDelay that were attached to mobs with coordinates.  For each, I infilled some fields from wiki and/or similar pools.  Changes include:

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bravo  | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bravo)  | made SPAWNTYPE_SCRIPTED |

Merges by staff into `release` have been disabled for the duration of the Return Home to Vana'diel campaign.

Due to the timing of this submission, I will merge this Pull Request into `release` once it has approval from a second staff member.
