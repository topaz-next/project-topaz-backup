On retail, mobs will wallhack any time they can't path to a target, even if it is "in range". This is meant to prevent issues like mobs not being able to path through doors, over obstacles like plants and rocks, players targeting mobs via /fillmode to un-pathable locations, and other navmesh exploits. The funniest example of this I can think of is Charybdis can't pass through the door to his lair, even when it's opened.

Issue known but unresolved on DSP for a long time, [see here](github/DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 3930).
