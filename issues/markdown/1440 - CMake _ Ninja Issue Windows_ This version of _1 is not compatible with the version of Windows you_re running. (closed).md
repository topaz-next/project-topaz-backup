- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

install directory: C:/topaz so its not the spaces issue of the other issue

open the CMakeLists.txt in visual studio 16.7.7 [worked for 16.4.5ish]

select x86 release/ x86 debug 

same issue


"This version of %1 is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information and then contact the software publisher"

Perform complete reinstall of visual studio community, just in case. [does not revert Visual Studio version]

This vm is x86 32bit not 64bit

I was using 16.7.6, and I've just updated to 16.7.7 - all targets work as expected.
If your VM doesn't work as expected, you can try and build with cmd:

If June won't build, there's a problem with your VM for sure ðŸ’€

What are the warnings that are tripping up your build? We won't be turning off warning-as-errors, but it'll be useful to see what you're getting

Updated the title of this so it's searchable, and leaving this link here:
https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/issues/18476

It appears that for whatever reason, the underlying makefile generator `Ninja` is failing on your VM. One solution to this could be swapping to `NMake` for Windows. I'll put this in my TODO list and I'll do the swap if it doesn't affect the build too much.

As long as you have a way to build, I'm going to close this issue.
