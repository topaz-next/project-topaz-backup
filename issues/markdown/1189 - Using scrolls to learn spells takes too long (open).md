**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
On retail when you have several scrolls to use to learn corresponding spells, you can start using the next one as soon as the previous one has disappeared from your inventory.
Here you have to wait until animation is completely done, so like ~4 additional seconds
(particularly annoying when you need to learn 10+ spells!^^)
