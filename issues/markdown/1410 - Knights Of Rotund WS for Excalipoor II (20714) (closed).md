@zach2good so turns out all 6 of those rows already exist with those exact values. I've now added the item mod row, which was all that was left.

I could have sworn I already added all of this back in DSP but when I saw the weaponskill row and script missing thought I must have been mistaken. Its half there half not there, only git blame knows for sure now.
