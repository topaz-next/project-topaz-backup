**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
This can be reproduced on any job; for a specific reproduction, use pld's shield bash ability, then create a macro /ja "shield bash" <t>, and spam it on the mob while shield bash is on cooldown. It will result in your never attacking because your weapon delay is reset.
