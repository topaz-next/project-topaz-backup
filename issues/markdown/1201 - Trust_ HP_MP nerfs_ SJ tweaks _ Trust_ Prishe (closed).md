**Done**
- Dropped the HP/MP base for growth for Trusts, allowed trusts to get MP based off their subjobs.
- Take Trust SJs into account when seeing if they can cast a spell
- Add Trust: Prishe. Luckily, her moves are already programmed as they are used at the end of COP, so just has to assign them.

...she'd not very good.. Oof.

**Not in this PR**
- Getting the cipher
- The cutscenes and associated TrustMemory arguments for when you receive Prishe's cipher.
