Duoing as SMN I've noticed that if my duo buddy summons lets say Ifrit, uses Double Punch and I attempt to resummon in a range of >30 I get hate regardless of if Ifrit does damage or not. But if I'm 30 or more yalms away I do not get hate. Not retail behavior.

It was fine roughly 3 months ago, this seems to have been recent and ongoing. Many other summoners can relate.

try again after updating to github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/commit/d3fee59d0d47d57760db06b9d277d50fb7d65ee6

EDIT: reread the issue, that commit prolly doesnt fix that
