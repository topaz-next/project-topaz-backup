We need one single convention, either underscore and a 1 or not, but not half one cor the core and half the other in lua. This is likely what lead to the issue solved in #1448 so lets pick one and make sure all effects with multiple versions are done the same way.

For Curse, I will merge a Pull Request that changes all "Curse 1" to just curse, and "Curse 2" (ST20) to "Zombie".

am concerned having names of effects not match client will potentially cause additional confusion points. in the dats, both curses are just listed as "curse". I _swear to god_ there were _three_ but Bane is its own effect now apparently, sitting at the ID I thought was our man.
