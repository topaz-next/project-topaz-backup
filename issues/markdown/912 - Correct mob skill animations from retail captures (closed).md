_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 912_

----

Based off of [this ActionView database](https://github.com/ibm2431/addons/blob/master/capture/data/actionview/category/Mb-TP.lua), which is the combined work of my, aether's, Nyu's, and Wiggo's passive retail data collection thus far.

New SQL file was generated by a small Lua tool that stepped through our current SQL, checked if the AView DB had a record, and then spit out a replacement line if AView's animation ID didn't match our SQL's animation ID.

(Read: Since this was done by a tool, there isn't room for manual data error on my part.)

I then reviewed the diff and dealt with removing commented double entries (ie: Omega's skills) and adjusting the skill lists of Hurkan and Snapweeds to account for the fact that the skill IDs were one off.
