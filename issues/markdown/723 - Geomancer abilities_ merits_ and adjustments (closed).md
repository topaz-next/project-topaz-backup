_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 723_

----

I needed to take Omni's geo branch into our repository to regain control over pushing commits to it.

---

This is the work relating to Geomancer abilities, merits, and other adjustments made since the initial April submission of #494.

I have not reviewed it yet.

As @Omnione won't be the author of this Pull Request - and therefore won't be able to push additional commits - review items will have to be addressed in a future Pull Request.

Please review as if this were a normal Pull Request. We'll compile a list of work items that needs to be done for this branch prior to a merge into canary.

~~There is a setting that allows upstreams (thats topaz) to push to forks on the fork persons end (omni) just fyi~~ Beta feature, disregard. The existing feature everyone has is to allow per-pullrequest, and per repository isn't a thing (yet). An alternative is to add collaborators though, which would work that way (full repo access).

There is, and it's enabled by default when a downstream opens a PR, but apparently it doesn't enable if someone other than the downstream owner opens the PR (the case in #700).
