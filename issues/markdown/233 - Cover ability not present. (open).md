I'm know this is extremely basic and wrong in some points but something like this would be where I would start personally.

i don't think any of the necessary stuff to make it work are implemented
yet (ie, the checks when being attacked for the effect)

I do, but my code is missing too much for me to submit it properly. Doesn't calculate half the things that are apart of cover like the VIT formula and enmity added to paladin and subtracted from target.

also something to consider whenever someone starts working on this:
-the case of 2 or more PLD's in a party, being able to determine which PLD the active cover effect belongs to

I've done a lot of digging around trying to figure a way for damage transfer to work. There's stuff like transferEnmity which is for accomplice and collaborator. Or trickattackPartner which lets the code know who's receiving enmity. What I can't wrap my head around is how damage is received. I'm sure it's buried somewhere but if we could say something like

```lua
--Pseudocode------------------------------
while ability is active then
  player receives targets damage
  if damage >= 0 then
    player.addMod(dsp.mod.Enmity, +200)
    target:lowerEnmity(target, 10)
elseif gallant coronet equipped then
  transfer magical damage to player
elseif valor surcoat equipped then
  20% of damage transferred converted to mp.
end
-------------------------------------------------------
function onUseAbility(player,target,ability)
--formula from https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Cover
local baseDuration = 15;
local bonusTime = utils.clamp(math.floor((player:getMod(dsp.mod.VIT) + player:getMod(dsp.mod.MND) - target:getMod(dsp.mod.VIT) * 2) / 4), 0, 15)
local duration = baseDuration + bonusTime;

player:addStatusEffect(player,dsp.effect.COVER,0,0,duration)

  if target:physicalDmgTaken >= 0 then
    player.addMod(dsp.mod.Enmity, +200)
    target:lowerEnmity(target, 10)
  end
end;
```
I assume Gallant Coronet and Surcoat are handled within their own files instead of the ability file, if so, that wont be needed here.
