First tested with a few types of dart darts, grenades, and even an imperial egg - it is impossible to "move and interrupt your aim" *(even with the 999 delay egg)* indicating the delay is not being correctly factored into the ranged attack wind-up.

Different issue still affecting darts: [Darts still use the singing skill animation](github/DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 3630) *(this also applies to imperial egg)*

this is intentional, as sources indicated (at the time) that ranged weapon
delay is the "aiming" time, and ammo delay is the action cooldown after
it's shot/thrown

if you can show that this isn't the case, it's easy enough to change

if its happening, the real bug would be not getting interrupted if your end of animation pos doesn't match the pos you started at (you can run around on retail as long as you stop where you started before it goes off - how this looks client side will depend heavily on your latency)

TeoTwawki are you saying even with 0 delay the throw should only occur after the animation/wind up time? If so I can double check but pretty much confirm this isn't the case and the throw/damage is being triggered at the start as I was unable to interrupt on a local server with no latency.

Confirmed on retail if you move during the animation/ wind-up time you receive the message 'You move and interrupt your aim".

unless snapshot activates in which case next shot will have no delay or be shot immediately after I believe
mistake not snapshot >>> rapid shot correction

confirmed ammo delay is being accounted for using Silver bullet Tp shot was 183, removed weapon to reset tp count changed to platinum bullet tp shot became 184 which confirms delay from 240 from silver bullet to delay of 249 platinum is being counted for.

Vampric Is it possible to take a video on retail to show this? It would help the devs to make the corrections.

I am currently not on retail atm but will ask a friend of mine to see if I can get that recorded. my testing was done on a private server.
