Since there is only a little formatting to do, I'm going to merge this and then ninja in the formatting so @rude-jerk can continue with what he's doing. Thanks for the contribution! üëç

Sorry, I've been trying to get back to fixing this up, just got swamped with class work and haven't got the chance to fix up the formatting, my apologies :(.
