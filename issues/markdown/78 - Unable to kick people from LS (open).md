_Originally opened as DarkstarProject/darkstar - Issue 2569_

----

When using the "kick" command as a sack or shell-holder it will remove someone from linkshell group, but will not break their pearl. All they have to do to get back in is re-equip it.

It should be replacing their pearl in inventory with an identically colored broken one that is unequipable for shell chat.

I also believe in retail you had to have a sack to a linkshell to trade a pearl, even if you had an extra one in inventory. I believe darkstar will currently let pearls be traded freely once they are created.

Edit: It seems that kicking people works if they have the LS in their first linkshell slot but not if they have it in their second. Also the broken linkpearl on retail would have the shell name grayed out of the LS it used to be and was the same color as that LS (minor stuff).

I am not a sackholder, but can confirm it's possible to trade pearls freely. I was able to give my pearl from one of my characters to a new player on the server. On the other hand I'm not sure if that was possible on retail or not.

Just a quick poke/bump.  This is still an issue and has the potential to be annoying/disruptive.
