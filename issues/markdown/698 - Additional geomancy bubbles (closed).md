_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 698_

----

These are the scripts related to geomancy bubbles as of #494.

I have not reviewed them yet.

As @Omnione won't be the author of this Pull Request - and therefore won't be able to push additional commits - review items will have to be addressed in a future Pull Request.

Please review as if this were a normal Pull Request. We'll compile a list of work items that needs to be done for this branch prior to a merge into canary.

Update: This will be delayed until after #831 fixes our elemental wheel. Then I'll once again _radically rebase and force push_ this branch.

I've done a medium-strength pass over this, leaving only (and most importantly) `geo.lua` to look over. It mainly needs to conform to the elemental ordering work ibm was doing.
