**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

These can be easily scripted right now. 

Hunt Regimes are very similar to Fields of Valor but the targets are NMs and the rewards are evoliths instead of exp. This is separate from Elite FoV pages. The evolith item carries augments on it as if it were equipment. The only part we can't do is synergy to transfer the evolith's augment data onto equipment **because synergy doesn't exist yet.**

Dominion ops pages are similar to Fields of Valor for Abyssea zones. We don't yet have regional influence for dominion op zones and the mobs themselves aren't retail accurate\* yet but for testing the mob only needs to spawn and die properly and that already works 

\* (retail abyssea mobs have level changes when killed - the quicker you mow them down the stronger they get, and will delevel themselves back to normal once left idle for a time).
