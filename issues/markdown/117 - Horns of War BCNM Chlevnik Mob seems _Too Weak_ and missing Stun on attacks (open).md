**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:**
master

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:**
First off, it doesn't cast Meteor. Secondly, I never fought this mob in retail but I always thought it was supposed to be around the difficulty of King Behemoth. These are a few missing things:
1. Thunderbolt does 150-300 dmg. I feet this damage needs to be increased. KB Thunderbolt, if spammed twice, can two shot my Tarus. I'm unsure if this is retail behavior, but it does add a level of difficulty to the mob.
2. This mob doesn't have "Additional Effect: Stun" on melee hits.

Thunderbolt damage is true to retail. It was toned down on KB several months ago and would likely no longer two shot a taru.

Chlevnik does need to be able to cast meteor.

Adding on to this, I don't think Chlevnik has the death meteor (which is an
ability, not a spell) and the "can't die until used" part.

Honestly I didn't know these bcnms were even accessible yet, or I probably
would have done that a long time ago

I know wiki isn't 100% correct but here: http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Horns_of_War

http://ffxiclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Chlevnik

and BG's wiki https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Chlevnik

They all say he uses Meteor.
