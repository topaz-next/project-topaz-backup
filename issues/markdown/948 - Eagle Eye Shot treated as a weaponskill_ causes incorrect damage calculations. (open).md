**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Currently, Eagle Eye Shot gets run through "doRangedWeaponskill" in its script.  The calculation ends up causing its damage to suffer compared to how it should according to the wiki: "Damage of Eagle Eye Shot = Damage of 1 ranged attack * 5.00.
Eagle Eye Shot can score a critical hit, although it will not be indicated in the chat log (aside from the higher damage inflicted)."

Thanks to Eren@GoldSaucer for bringing this up.
