I believe the distance check added to Treasure Hunter on Topaz/DSP was due to myths at the time which have since been disproven. Of course TH in it's entirety needs to be reworked but this is a quick fix to remove an annoying "bug" if you will, for now.

Currently with this check you must be within 25-28 yalms for TH to apply to a mob or NM and removing it eliminates the need for that.

They have also released more recent information on Treasure Hunter that disproves that that there was a range check as well as other myths/rumors.
