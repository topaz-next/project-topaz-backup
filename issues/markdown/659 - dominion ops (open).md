_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 659_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

Can be easily scripted right now.

Dominion ops pages are similar to Fields of Valor for Abyssea zones. We don't yet have regional influence for dominion op zones and the mobs themselves aren't retail accurate\* yet but for testing the mob only needs to spawn and die properly and that already works

\* (retail abyssea mobs have level changes when killed - the quicker you mow them down the stronger they get, and will delevel themselves back to normal once left idle for a time).

Thanks for your opinion.

They can be if the existing dev team wants them to be. thats called a feature request in most projects. This was split of a previous issue after half of it was covered.

Its here because its simplistic work someone can get experience from by building on existing functionality.
