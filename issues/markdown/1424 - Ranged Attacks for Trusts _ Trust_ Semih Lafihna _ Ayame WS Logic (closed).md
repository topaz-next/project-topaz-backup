**TODO**
- Ranged WS animations for Semih are messed up.

```
        [3487] = {['name']="Sidewinder",                     ['category']=11, ['id']=3487, ['animation']=429,  ['message']=185, },
        [3489] = {['name']="Stellar Arrow",                  ['category']=11, ['id']=3489, ['animation']=430,  ['message']=185, },
        [3490] = {['name']="Lux Arrow",                      ['category']=11, ['id']=3490, ['animation']=431,  ['message']=185, },
```

- Actionview shows the category, id, animation and message are all same between retail and my changes...
- Model is correct, capped from retail...

**DONE**
- Basic RA for trusts
- AI for Semih
- Trusts stop running are 3 ticks of being chased ðŸ’€
- I think I'm going to have to move all the RA stuff down into BattleEntity, it just makes sense. Even if it's stubbed.
- Sane damage and delay for RA
- Throwing support for Joachim
- Bindings to tell Trusts to use RA
```lua
    mob:addSimpleGambit(ai.t.TARGET, ai.c.ALWAYS, 0,
                        ai.r.RA, 0, 0) -- Try RA all the time, but bound by your weapon's delay
```

I'm surprised it already isn't. Do Goblin Ambushers currently not Ranged Attack?

There are 2 types of ranged attack mob type objects can use. one is a "real" ranged attack, the other is a mobskill faking a ranged attack. A case of SE having multiple devs who didn't communicate to each other how they implemented. In game on retail, you can tell them apart by how the message displays: 1 line of text with no line break, or 2.

_both_ types should be handled at battelentity imo.
