_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1257_

----

1: ZilartStatus needs to be '257' not '255', because it started at 2 and 255 was added.
2: You need to re-get the char var when checking to start cutscene upon selecting the last Pedestal because it was added to, so the check looks at the old stored variable instead of the updated one.

It looks like the pedestals are already using a standard bitmask that starts at 1 with the Pedestal of Fire. Bitmask of 8 bits = 255.

[I don't see ZilartStatus being set to an initial value after the completion of the BCNM](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/scripts/zones/Chamber_of_Oracles/bcnms/through_the_quicksand_caves.lua#L34-L36).
