_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 536_

----

I _assume_ this will also let GMs escape their moghouses. But for all I know @zach2good might just have an overly attached Moogle.

Will need another commit to clean up the eventFinishes, which I spaced.

Thanks for pointing them out, Dera!

Removed the no longer accessible eventFinishes which I forgot.

I did not need to do so for Adoulin because the nagging Moogles never made it there.

Nor the Shadowreign cities because although the events were being started, they had no finishes and _never once set a homepoint_.
