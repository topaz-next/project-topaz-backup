_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 685_

----

This PR will introduce the visitant light system for Abyssea, it will currently do nothing but control the lights that a player receives after killing a mob in an  Abyssea zone, all mobs have been mapped for the lights they should give, and all light values are as retail unless no information could be found, in which case the value will be an estimate based on other mobs of the same family in the same tier.

The lights that drop will be dependent on the way the mob has been killed as per retail.

All information has been collated and checked on multiple sites and also from retail testing. 

I have included GM commands to add lights and reset lights accordingly (!addlights and !resetlights).

special thanks to Lynnea of then Dawnbreak server for the help on this.
