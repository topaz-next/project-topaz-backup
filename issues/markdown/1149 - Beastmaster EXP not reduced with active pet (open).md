**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

It doesn't appear that Beastmasters with a pet get their EXP reduced. I have a memory of Square reducing the EXP cut at some point, but some EXP cut is still present in the game to this day.

From modern day [FFXIclopedia](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Beastmaster):

> No experience point penalty is incurred unless the charmed pet is a higher level than the Beastmaster.
> If the Beastmaster uses a pet of a higher level than the highest level party member, the pet's level is used as the highest level party member for purposes of calculating Experience Points. A Beastmaster's pet has no other effects on Experience Points.

The exp cut has been completely removed unless the pet is higher level than you, no?

reminder that when this was/is a thing, it only affected the bst, not the whole party. I thought they removed this but maybe its been forgotten about because jugs came into focus instead of charm way back when abyssea hit and its like "lol who charms anymore?" now. the phrasing on that page you linked is SUPER OLD and having not changed in nearly 10 years, other sections having gotten unrelated updates. There used to be a generic 30% cut in old old old retail (2004 ish) and was removed around 2007 I think, but still applies to _adventuring fellow_ npc helpers.

found it:
* After the August 27, 2007 update, charmed Beastmaster pets no longer incur an XP penalty
