----

Base skill (ie. before merits/gear) is the higher of three values: Actual base skill (implemented), B+ - the amount the skill is from its actual cap, but only if the job has it natively (implemented), and some seemingly arbitrary value (not implemented). I say seemingly random because it appears to have no relation to any existing skill ranks, meaning a new one would be needed to be made for it.

As for the data, teschnei collected it a while ago, and I recorded it. It can be viewed here: http://pastebin.com/S00mVFnf Note that level 1-19 is left out because it's not possible to get values for those.
