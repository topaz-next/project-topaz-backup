Azure lore is one of the 1 hour abilities a player can use to unlock SCH through the quest "A Little Knowledge".  One of the players on Gold Saucer used the ability and tried to unlock sch, but the ability wasn't scripted and therefore didn't give the effect, so the player was confused about what was going on.  Though I doubt the effect does much of anything, now it's applied when a player uses the ability.
