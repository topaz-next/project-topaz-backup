_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 355_

----

Corrects /adds any inaccurate or missing damage types.

Also updated the param value in the Lua table to use `damageType`
instead of `dmgtype`. This better matches the enum value naming
convention for `tpz.damageType`.

NOTE: This will conflict with https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/346, but there's some open comments still on that PR so this can probably go in head of it since it should be more straightforward.
