_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 370_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->
**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
**The quest:**
https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_Defiant_Challenge

**can be completed by collecting the key items:**
KeyItem: Exoray mold crumb
KeyItem: Bomb coal fragment
KeyItem: Ancient papyrus shred

all of which have the logic to obtain them written.

Would just need to be hooked up in the maat NPC file:
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/scripts/zones/RuLude_Gardens/npcs/Maat.lua

This would make a good starter issue if we have a tag for that.

I am a potato, this isn't how the quest works!
