*I'm making this issue because I have zero intention of fixing it myself. Namely because I already did and then someone destroyed my work before I could share. Angry about it, not explaining further. There is just no way I am doing it twice (inc my t2 carol scripts, gdi). Not gonna happen. /flush*

Example:
https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Category:Carol
That is not how DSP is doing carol effects right now. DSP script sare using values stated on ffxiclopedia, I don't know if these were taken out of context or if SE changed it (probably the latter) but this isn't what retail is doing now. ffxiclopedia says T1 cap at 40, bg says T1 base 80. T2 at base 100.

This is a request to update old scripts, and fill in a lot of stupid easy to do new ones. Btw there is a lot of crap logic/extraneous code. If your variable is just `x*y` you may as well just define the variable as that up front instead of defining it as `x` then redefining it as `x*y` immediately after.

bad effect flags combined with a reliance on a zoneflag when not all zones are getting the mazurka flag correctly on/off.
