_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1499_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

Next up in my unrelenting march to turn this mess into a corporate code utopia. 
I've been testing this on my fork, it works very nicely and is FREEEEEEEEEE.

There _is_ support for running this on PRs and having Sonar leave comments telling you about your changes, but I feel like a robot telling you your code is trash would be demoralising to newcomers.

Currently runs once a day at midnight

**TODO**
- Make SonarCloud account for topaz
- Add `${{ secrets.SONAR_TOKEN }}` to repo
