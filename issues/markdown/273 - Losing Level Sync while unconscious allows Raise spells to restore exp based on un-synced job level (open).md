**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

**_Scenario:_**
- level 70+ character syncs down to level 10 party leader, is KOd by random enemy, loses ~300 experience
- party leader removes sync, waits for removal message
- A third character casts Raise III on the now-unconscious level 70+ character, who pops back up and ~~gains~~ recovers 2,160 experience *(2,400 cap * 0.9)* for a net gain of ~1,850 exp

Granted this is hardly a super-efficient "exploit" *(though not terrible by any means)* - just aiming to demonstrate the issue.
