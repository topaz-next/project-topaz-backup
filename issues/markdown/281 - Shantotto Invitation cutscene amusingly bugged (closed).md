Demonstration Video: https://youtu.be/uFmg_90QrMI (After the 30 second mark. Video doesn't have audio)

Description: A moogle dressed NPC floats in from the top. Video was the best way to demonstrate and describe the bug.

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to checkmark box -->

**_I have:_**

- [x] checked the commit log to see if my issue has been resolved since my server was last updated


<!-- Issues will be closed without being looked into if the following information is missing (unless its not applicable). -->

**_Client Version_** (type `/ver` in game) **:** 30190305_0


**_Source Branch_** (master/stable) **:** Master. Built yesterday. According to TortioseGit it was built from github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/commit/7110b3402eb58a0752a182747bf4fcd4cda0cf51


<!-- If there is a server you know we can reproduce this on right now, please mention it here. -->
**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** Just playing on a local server alone with a multibox setup. After experiencing the Shantotto Ascension opening cutscene, as well as going and acquiring the quest to get Summoner, left from Windurst Waters into West Sarutabaruta triggering the cutscene of Shantotto's invitation letter. That's all I did to trigger the bug. All four characters encountered the same cutscenes relatively at the same time. All four encountered the bug as well.

None of the characters are wearing the outfit. Besides the one in the video, the other three are wearing level 50 gear.

Client / version match, so my guess is that - due to the zone - there was a misalignment at some point during SE's constant shifting of "event" zones. Might need a recapture.

I think I encountered another possibly related issue, though this time not in a cutscene. Sadly no video this time. But I got a screenshot.

Desc: Saw a ferry (note: not airship) fly through the air in Sauromuge Campaign. Going west to east down the center of the map. It was flying low enough it would have clipped through the mountains and ruins, though I was not at the right angle to see it do so.

Happens when coming into the Campaign from the south heading straight north. Though I do have speed set to to 40 or 60, so at regular speeds it could be easily missed.

I like this better... leave it... It is now canon and retail is wrong.
