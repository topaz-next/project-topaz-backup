**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 
The spell itself does what its supposed to. However unless you use another pet using job as a sub you have no commands to control it (also an expected retail behavior) but on retail, the mob you charmed will defend you like carbuncle (only acts to attack something that is attacking you). Melee only - it won't mobskill unless you use a command as in brd/bst
