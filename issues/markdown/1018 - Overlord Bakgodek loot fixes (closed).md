1) Grouped Highlander Targe and Nightmare sword together, if one drops the other doesn't.

3) Changed Juggernaut from 7% to 24% drop rate (very common tier using newest TH chart data).

Prior to the 2007 version update the drop rate was reportedly 80-100% before they moved it to the KSNM99 and dropped the rate. The drop rate listed on FFXIDB is post-nerf, with TH2 at ~50% drop rate, so I believe a 24% rate is fair, but 7% was definitely way too low.

Changed 30% to 24% thanks to Tankfest for notifying me about the tier / TH drop rate system groupings.

Apologize about the 2nd commit for my amendment I did, have learned how to correctly edit commits in the future.
