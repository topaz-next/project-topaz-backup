**_I have:_**

- [x] searched existing issues (http://project-topaz.com/issues/) to see if the issue has already been opened
- [x] checked the commit log to see if the issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

**_Additional Information_** (Steps to reproduce/Expected behavior) **:** 

**Home moghouse menu > Remodel > Pick a style**

**In Game:** Nothing Happens
**Server Log:** `[Warning] SmallPacket0x0CB : unknown byte <05>`

I think this would be a `good first issue` for someone wanting to start learning the full program ecosystem. 
This would involve:
- Reading/writing from the DB
- Implementing packets
- Obtaining/reviewing captures
- General work in core

Probably good for someone with a little C++/DB knowledge who has spent time writing scripts and wants to dig deeper.

_(if nobody picks this up in a couple of months I'll probably take it, because it looks like fun)_
