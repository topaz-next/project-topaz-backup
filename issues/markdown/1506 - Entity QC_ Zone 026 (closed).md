* Update npcs from retail captures.

* One QM -- formerly qm2 -- is related to quest [Unforgiven](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Unforgiven).  I renamed the QM accordingly.

* Five QMs -- formerly qm4 through qm8 -- are related to quest [In Search of the Truth](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/In_Search_of_the_Truth).  I renamed the QMs accordingly, and added a zones[].npc reference that can be used to implement the quest later.  Implementation is outside scope of these entity QC PRs.
