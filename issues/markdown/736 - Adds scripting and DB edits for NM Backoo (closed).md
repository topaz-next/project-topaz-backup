It should be noted that its spawn position input in the database is a rough guesstimate based on what ffxiclopedia had to say.  Could use a capture (should be fairly easy given his regular spawn timing) to determine more accurate spawn coords.

edit: Nyu provided a retail capture for his position, thanks!
