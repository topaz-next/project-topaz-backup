_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 591_

----

Adds the second tier Threnody spells. As these are awarded by gifts, there is no valid method for players to obtain them yet. There also seems to be a client lockout preventing them from appearing if !addallspells is used. However, mobs are capable of using them, including Siren.

Does she actually cast in captures? The other avatars all fake their spells via mobskills. For both player pet and the primes, I believe. If she's actually a for-realz-caster ima custom the heck outa this :smiling_imp:

In this instance, it's the NM Siren, not the summoned avatar:
