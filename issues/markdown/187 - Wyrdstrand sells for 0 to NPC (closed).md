This is exactly why its zero. Zero is a placeholder for "we don't know yet". Also used when sites disagree and we don't want to guess which one is right.

A great many items have this problem. What is needed is someone to get on retail and check it, taking their fame modification to the price (if any) into account (or just selling someplace not modified by fame).

Hello. Both of them have a price documented now. As for the Wyrdstrand, my retail capture shows a price at 1319 gils (sold multiple of them).

It's in `item_basic` table:

https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/sql/item_basic.sql

```
itemid, subid, name, sortname, stackSize, flags, aH, NoSale, BaseSell
'3550', '0', 'spool_of_wyrdstrand', 'wyrdstrand', '12', '4', '40', '1', '0'

The captured `1319` is lower than the range specified in https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wyrdstrand

That claims `1,360~1,394 gil`. But I'm tempted to lean toward an actual capture over the data from the wiki, which could be stale.

â€˜Clopedia usually has outdated proces tbat ppl did not accurately gauge fame on so they guesstimated - wiki is rarely confirming these once someone adds one

Selling an item in a non fame effected area on retail is the most accurate info we can get
