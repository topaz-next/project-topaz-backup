Still a ton to do before this is ready: see issue #792


Future plans but not in the scope of this pull request: spike effects on armor too. Some ground work is set here but I have made no attempt to transition those at this time.

I am now -reasonably- sure I won't be changing the procType enum I am using, if anyone wants to throw item mods to the additional Effect branch I am working off I'd be very grateful. This could go to a tpz branch to be easier to pr too, while I continue to clean up the global script (its functional right now, if mods are added for items) if that is desired. I still have a lot of work to do on the script end to make it maintainable.
```lua
    local procType =

@TeoTwawki I am adding some "item_mods" 431 additional effect, and since I am not submitting the scripts for these items, the (id,431,1) is just orphaned. I will just add them in using this style, but I need to know how to do it.
Based on your above, for example, item_mods for example, poison.
`INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,431,1);   -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison`

How would I make this a full entry in your style?

@helixhamin The new style takes more than one mod. The mods already exist in both release and canary but arenâ€™t used until my pr merges.

In addition to 431, you need 499 (subeffect, this is the animation. Poison animation is 10) 501 (proc rate, 1-100 %) for any and all add effects.

For status such as en-posion, you also need:
951: status effect id
952: power - how big a poison are you inflicting?
953: duration - how long does the poison last?

Those 3 are not needed for damage effects, only status. Damage will use 950 however to tell it which elemental resistance to check, and 500 to tell it how hard to hit.

Okay, so I have:
`function onAdditionalEffect(player,target,damage)
    local chance = 10

    if (math.random(0,99) >= chance or target:isUndead()) then
        return 0,0,0
    else
        target:delStatusEffect(tpz.effect.POISON)
        target:addStatusEffect(tpz.effect.POISON, 4, 3, 30)
        return tpz.subEffect.POISON, tpz.msg.basic.ADD_EFFECT_STATUS, tpz.effect.POISON
    end
end`

This should be converted as follows:
`INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,431,1);   -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison

INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,499,10);  -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison

INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,951,3);   -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison

INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,952,4);   -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison

INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,953,30);  -- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison`

Just to make sure this is being done right. Is this correct?

You missed 501 for the proc chance. you want:
```sql
-- Venom Katars - Additional effect: Poison
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,431,1);  -- Additional effect type
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,499,10); -- Additional effect animation (subeffect)
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,501,10); -- Additional effect proc chance
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,951,3);  -- Additional effect status ID
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,952,4);  -- Additional effect status potency
INSERT INTO `item_mods` VALUES (16404,953,30); -- Additional effect status duration
```

The target branch needs to be even with release now, due to shiva's claws.

I have actually found a few more mistakes on my own, will cleanup this weekend. Hopefully before they get noticed. Wasn't as ready as I thought. it *looked* working in game, but only visually.

ok, except for what I am trying to put to a separate pr after, I think I have this all cleaned up now

(reasoning: I want to enable people to add the sql lines while I kill the if/else blocks without having to wait for me to see that their sql is correct)
