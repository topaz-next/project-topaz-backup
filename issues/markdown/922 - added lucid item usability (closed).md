----

changed casting time to 1 second and added script, now caskets should be livelier

1 thing missing would be lucid_wings_i and lucid_wings_ii that are still missing. If someone sees this PR and can mimic the same for those 2 items would be awesome =)

Thank you @Omnione  for making caskets available =)
