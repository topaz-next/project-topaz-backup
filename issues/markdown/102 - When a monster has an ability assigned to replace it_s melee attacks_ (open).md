**_I have:_**
- [x] searched existing issues (http://github.com/darkstarproject/darkstar - Issue ) to see if the issue I am posting has already been addressed or opened by another contributor
- [x] checked the commit log to see if my issue has been resolved since my server was last updated

Follow on from previous issue with latest code:
Darkstar Issue 1) Mobs now aren't following until you're a significant distance away. In this screen shot, I'm 17' away, and mobs are still attacking (I'm taking damage) - but their attack animation isn't happening in game.

Once I get to 20', they start following... but stop at 19.8'

Ability is set to 12.0 in database.

The 12' trigger was working prior to this update, with the bug that monsters then got too close.
Darkstar Issue 2) Monsters now don't turn to face me when using their ability; I can be stood behind them, and they'll shoot it facing away from me.
