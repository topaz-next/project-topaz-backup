Were any spells cast on mob? Even if melee is doing zero if you cast on them thats tp. Need a specific mob you were doing this on, what thing were hitting mob (or an affirmation nothing hit mob at all and it was merely hitting you for zero) so we can verify.

If legit, this may be specific to how stoneskin is handled. Getting hot for zero because stoneskin, with tp as if stoneskin werenâ€™t involved.
