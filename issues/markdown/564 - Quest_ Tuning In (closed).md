Welcome, thanks for this PR!

I haven't tested the quest yet, but from a high level look everything seems OK! Just some style issues:

**Parens, no need for extras:**
```
if var == 1 then
    ...
end
```

**Try to use npcUtil when you can:**
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/scripts/globals/npc_util.lua

Here's some examples:

**Checking the contents of a trade:**

**Completing a Quest:**

Changes have been made. 
Although now the lines I've added stand out in the file, because the rest of the file doesn't follow those style guidelines yet :P
