_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1134_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

Also included: addition to `!speed` command to report values on use, and extra commenting of source.

**I thoroughly tested that the additions I made work, and that I did not break anything that wasn't already broken. Of things that WERE broken _before I got here(!!)_ I will be opening a detailed issue for in the near future.**

Note worthy: I verified on retail that chocobos/mounts are NOT simply double your speed. They are base 40 to the players 50, but the client doubles their "stride" effectively moving them at 80. 1 point of speed is worth 2 when mounted. Likewise flee is not "double speed" as was always thought, but I will go over that in my issue later.

Realized I said modifier instead of conf, so amended both pr title and commit message.

Modifier was something I tried to do (for that mount quest) but couldn't get working.
