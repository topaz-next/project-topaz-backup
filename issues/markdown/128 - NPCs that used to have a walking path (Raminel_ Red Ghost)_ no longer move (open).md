Can confirm this as well. Probably has something to do with Navmeshes?

Shouldn't be related to Navmeshes.  NPCs that have set paths don't use 
the Navmesh system to follow them; they use a set of pre-defined 
positions which are located in the NPCs lua file in most cases.

They seem to move fine for me for a little while on the latest commit (github/DarkstarProject/darkstar/commit/80077e89091f3189d5f31dbf263aec8b305715ed) & the latest client (30160728_0), but then they stop and don't seem to move again after talking to them.

Edit: Removed irrelevant info.
