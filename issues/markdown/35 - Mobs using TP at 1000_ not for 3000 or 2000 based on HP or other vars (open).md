Kthulupwns I think you are gonna have to be more descriptive. I know what you mean, but a lot of people wouldn't from just that issue title alone.

I seem to have misunderstood your issue, you said the title was too vague so i made it more specific. 

I imagine that this kind of functionality would be handled in cpp but honestly dont know, not in my wheel house

But the issue impacts gameplay on a fairly large scale because mobs using tp as soon as they hit 1000 actually makes most fights quite a lot harder then they should be.

A great example is like faust or despot. Now they used Panzerfaust/Typhoon quite a lot on retail. but there was a 2-3 second pause even with a bit of tp on it as where here it will litearlly not stop queueing them.

> I seem to have misunderstood your issue, you said the title was too vague so i made it more specific. 

What I said was a lot of people aren't going to understand from that title alone - as in elaborate. If I meant your title sucks I'd say "dude, your title sucks". I'm just a little frustrated at the many issues that have been being opened by multiple people with nothing but a title. What you added could have just been a reply, would have been fine. 

Its fine now if ppl got questions after this they can ask you.

> I imagine that this kind of functionality would be handled in cpp but honestly dont know, not in my wheel house

Its pretty much a combination of not much documentation on retails mob AI behaviors and that there isn't much AI in the project yet to decide how frequently things should happen at which TP amounts. That may be easier to handle after the AI rewrite is finished.

I completely understand, I'll try to have more specificity in my pulls/issues submits.

Faust and Despot are really awful examples of this, considering they are both scripted to use their mobskills multiple times in succession (ie. them spamming WS is totally intended)

a better example would be the rate fafnir gains tp, or even nidhogg/vrtra, jailer of love, or even Jormungand

"Typhoon - 10' AoE physical damage and knockback, absorbed by 1-2 Shadow Images. Used always two times in a row, having a short break each time before repeating, regardless of TP gain."

what i meant is that the mobs should hold their tp briefly between tp moves.

and HNMs all have a big amount of regain - are you seeing this on regular mobs or just bosses/scripted NMs?

its a universal issue. Both regular mobs and scripted nms

looks like every mob by default has a 30% chance to use a TP move every 500ms when between 1000 and 3000 tp - it may be too high, but it's a simple change in mobentity.h to tweak.  For now I won't touch it (since I'm rewriting the AI anyways), but it is something to keep in mind for that

I was discussing this issue with someone in IRC a while back - they claim that in retail the mob's chance to use a tp move begins at a very very low number when they reach 1000TP and scales geometrically with TP until reaching 100% at 3000TP (note this only applies when the mob's HP is >25% - <25% they always use them at 1000TP)

I personally cannot corroborate the validity of this claim, but it sounds legit :p
