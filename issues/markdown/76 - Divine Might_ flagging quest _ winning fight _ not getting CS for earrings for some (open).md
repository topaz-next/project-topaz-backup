This happened to several people on our server. Some got the CS to obtain the earrings and others didn't. We keep getting the CS that mentions that I need an Ark Pentasphere.

Everyone needs to check their quest log prior to the fight. If they don't have the Divine Might quest active, they don't get it, simple. What's not so simple, is what retail seemingly did, which is making sure you check the blank spot after the CS for it to actually give you the quest.

This is why many people miss out on the reward - they did not check it another time.

Well then, this check needs fixed. It's a DSP issue.

Are you sure it's not like this on retail as well? I know for sure that on retail you can enter without being on the quest itself, which allows people who've completed it to help out.

Well, I got the CS with Yve and Divine Might should have immediately flagged. It didn't. Therein lies the issue. Also, several other people doing this fight had the same issue.
