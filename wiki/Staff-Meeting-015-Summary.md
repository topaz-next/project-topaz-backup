# Closing Remarks
> The next Return to Vana'diel campaign will begin next week. I hope that we may meet next Thursday. As we did during the previous campaign, official staff activities will be paused for its duration to allow staff to maximize the time they have access to retail. We will not hold a meeting during the week of May 17th through May 23rd. Furthermore, to ensure that all staff have had opportunity to review Pull Requests, merges into `release` and `canary` will be disabled during the duration of the campaign. Community members are welcome to submit Pull Requests during this time! However, please give us your patience while waiting for a review.
