# Roll Call
aether, ibm2431, Nyu, Wiggo, Zircon
# Opening Remarks
> Today I would like to try having the "General Remarks" section prior to the "Open Pull Requests" section. I hope this might allow for those who are unable to stay for the full meeting to be provided with the opportunity to give any general remarks they might have without having to wait until after the "Open Pull Requests" and "Feature Branches" sections.
# Staff Updates
**aether**: Testing regarding claim mechanics; testing an implementation of Limbus; working on blue mage research

**ibm2431**: Reviewing Pull Requests; AI work for trusts and fellows

**Nyu**: Will begin capturing base sell prices; setting up FTP for captures; fixed a timing issue for Smoke on the Mountain 

**Wiggo**: Uploading captures; waiting on AI

# General Remarks
- Discussed when a project focus can be considered complete; Consul will be asked if they are satisified with progress; possibility for general public to be polled
- Discussed "What Works" section; Google Sheets will be used for quick collaboration and then exported to GitHub wiki; starting work will be things which Project Topaz has worked on due to immediate familiarity; categories to be determined
- Pull Requests which do not seek to add new contributions will not be considered Pull Requests for the purpose of staff meetings
