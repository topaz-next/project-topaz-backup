# Opening Remarks
> This past week has brought quite the change for both Project Topaz, and the private server community! We are seeing a dramatic increase in new faces to the project. For those of new faces just meeting us, we welcome all of you! For staff, the following weeks may be some of our most difficult as we strive to meet an increased demand while working towards our existing goals. Just do your best - I have the utmost confidence in all of you.

# Staff Updates
**aether**: Finished manual data entry on Blue Mage spreadsheet; reviewing Pull Requests

**ibm2431**: Reviewing Pull Requests; began work on versioning, but did not pan out; may do manual tagging for now

**Nyu**: Gathering information from retail; testing Pull Requests; researching setting up client; will add guide for pydarkstar

**Wiggo**: Captures

**Zircon**: Prepared survey for gathering feedback on potential new staff members

# General Remarks
- New staff selection process; interested members no longer require nomination from staff, and are to instead inquire directly with Zircon; Zircon will then send out a community survey to evaluate that member

# Closing Remarks
> We have had a very busy week! I thank all of you for your hard work, and welcome all new contributors and members of our community. I look forward to the future we will build together!

> I will make an announcement in the #announcements channel describing the new staff nomination process. Community members who are interested in becoming official staff of Project Topaz are encouraged to initiate conversation with me to express that interest, as opposed to the former process of obtaining a nomination from a current staff member.
