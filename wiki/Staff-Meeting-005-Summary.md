# Opening Remarks
> We have had a very busy week! I have had the pleasant opportunity to see many new faces in the server, and see several new contributors submitting Pull Requests.

> As we have previously discussed, we have added more Staff, which may make staff gatherings more difficult to coordinate. As such, I think we shall attempt to have smaller gatherings of specific teams to discuss the issues relating to those specific teams.

# General Remarks
- Decided on establishing a Stable branch. New features will be merged into separate branches and regularly merged into Master for testing. Additions and bug-fixes added to feature branch. When feature considered "stable", feature branch will be merged into Stable branch. Did not decide on exact rules for when a feature should be used, or how long until a feature branch is considered "stable".
- Discussed draft moderation policy for handling violations of Discord server rules. Zircon will adopt input into finalized version.
# Closing Remarks
> We have many more users in the Discord server with us than we did last week! I attribute it to all of your hard work in working with contributors and producing a positive working environment. With the project picking up steam, I am sure you will be very busy. Always remember that perfection is not required, nor is it expected. Just do your best. I have faith in all of you.
