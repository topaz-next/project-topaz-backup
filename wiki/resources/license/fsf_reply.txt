If someone modifies GPLv3 file (code) and adds copyrightable code to it, then that portion of the code can be under a compatible license (e.g. AGPLv3). Please see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html>. The original portions of code would still only have to follow the terms of the GPLv3. GPLv3‘s section 13 states "The terms of this License [GPLv3] will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such."

The modified code should remain under the initial license of the code.

In order a modification could be qualified as a derivative work entitled for copyright, it should meet a copyrightability criteria. Such modifications shouldn’t be trivial, they should be original.

The child class written from scratch and having additional functionality could be regarded as a copyrightable work and be licensed by its copyright holder under AGPLv3 and linked to GPLv3 code.

AGPLv3 files could be linked to GPLv3 code and the source code of the combined work should be made available to users interacting with the combined work over a network.

The copyright holder of any copyrightable work can license it under AGPLv3 and call from it (link to) GPLv3 code.

We always ask that if someone is going to publish our reply that they should give the whole reply, so that people can get the full context of what we said.
