# Closing Remarks
> I would like to thank Staff for their handling of the duplication exploit which was reported to us. You worked diligently to investigate, communicate, and resolve the issue. You have the gratitude of many downstream server administrators as well. While you may have seen some expressions of gratitude for how Project Topaz handled the situation, you have not seen those which were expressed to me privately. Multiple server administrators -- including those which have not adopted Project Topaz -- expressed that they were impressed by our process. One administrator even likened the rollout to that of professional web service firms.

> Secondly, due to the level of trust we established, I have begun receiving reports of other potential exploits. I do not believe this would be the case had it not been for your hard work. I will engage with Staff to investigate these possible exploits in the future.
