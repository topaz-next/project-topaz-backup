# Opening Remarks
> We seem to have gained a lot more members this past week! That is excellent to see. I welcome every new member of our community, and look forward to getting to know you all.
>
> Because of the new influx, we may want to establish a defined moderation policy. I doubt that we will need to use it any time in the near future, but it is good to have a plan just in case. We can discuss it during General Remarks, but please start thinking about it while we proceed.

    - Merged
# General Remarks
- KnowOne nominated and added to Staff
- Established formation of Community Council, which will be a collection of ambassadors that servers running Project Topaz choose to represent them. Consul members will be asked for input regarding Staff nominations and Project Focus selection. Additional powers may be granted later. Did not decide on exact rules for what qualifies a server for a Consul position beyond running Project Topaz. No decision on a server's number of Council seats increasing with server size.
# Closing Remarks
> Next week we can discuss a Moderator Policy, and any lingering questions over a Consul.
>
> However, if there are questions or concerns any of you have, you don't have to wait until the next meeting, you can always ask in this channel.
>
> I formally welcome KnowOne to the staff, and also ask our community to be kind to him!
>
> This has been a busy week for us, and I suspect this next week will be even more so. Just do your best. I have faith in all of you.
