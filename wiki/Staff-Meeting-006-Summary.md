> For community members who are reading this, I humbly thank you for your enthusiastic contributions! However, there seems to be a large influx of contributions recently, and it might take time for our staff to get through them all. Further, due to the Return to Vana'diel Campaign, our official project activities will be suspended until Monday, March 9th. We thank you for your patience.
