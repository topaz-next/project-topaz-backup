# Staff Updates

**aether**: Submitting Pull Requests; researching treasure coffer gil rates

**cocosolos**: Reviewing Pull Requests; submitting fixes; will work on hunts and database tools

**ibm2431**: Reviewing Pull Requests; primarily focusing on Geomancer Pull Requests

**Wiggo**: Pursuing automation to assist with capture process

# General Remarks
- Discussed when Pull Requests should be merged into `release` versus when they should be merged into new feature branches
- Zircon informed of minor additional changes to Pull Request review process; for consideration during Staff Meetings, the age of a Pull Request less than 1,000 additions will be three days since the last commit, or three days since it has been marked as ready to review, whichever is later
- Additionally, when official project activities are paused, the submission date of a Pull Request opened during the pause will be considered to be the date which official activities resume
- Zircon informed Staff of intent to have all Staff members reviewed every six months; and intention to have Staff other than cocosolos be the subject of a community survey; actual survey design not yet finalized
- Discussed potential changes in how Pull Requests are reviewed and merged to ease Staff burden and allow Staff to better focus on project goals, including the potential removal of the "automatically merge if not held" rule; Zircon will consider feedback from the community
