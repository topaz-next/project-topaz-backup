# Opening Remarks
> I believe it would be prudent for us to start developing a policy for handling merges of feature branches from `canary` into `release`. Absent a rigid policy, I will be adding a new section to these meetings titled "Feature Branches". We can use that section to discuss any outstanding feature branches that have not yet been merged into `release` and determine a timeline for when they might be. Servers who run Project Topaz would then have forewarning for when these branches will end up in `release`. This "Feature Branches" section will be after "Open Pull Requests". Suggestions regarding this new section may be shared during the "General Remarks" section.

# Closing Remarks
> As all of you are no doubt aware, there has been a widespread outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Since Project Topaz is already collaborated on entirely online, we do not need to make any plans to maintain "social distance". However, it is possible that staff members will become infected and feel unwell for an extended period of time. If this happens to you, please do not be afraid to let me know. If enough members fall under the weather to the point of it affecting work on the project, we may temporarily cease official project activities so staff members do not feel pressured to work on the project when they are unwell.
