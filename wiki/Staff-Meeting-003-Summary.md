# Closing Remarks
> I will start defining GitHub projects for the new focuses we have selected.
>
> I did not want to bring this up during the meeting and keep you both here even longer, but there is one other thing I would like the two of you to think about until next time.
>
> I am also considering a potential "advisory council" of server administrators which we might seek input from.
>
> I am always interested in improving relations with the general private server community, and feel we might benefit from making them feel more involved with development and project direction.
>
> However, as of right now, we do not have any servers using the project of which I am aware.
>
> So this would be some time in the future, and I do not know the exact form, or amount of weight, such a council might have.
>
> If the two of you want to start putting thought into it so we can discuss it at a later date, I would appreciate it.
