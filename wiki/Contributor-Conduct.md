Contributors to Project Topaz are expected to abide by the following Code of Conduct. Project Topaz reserves the right of sole judgement for what constitutes as a violation of the below.

# 1. Collaborative Service Official Rules
Any and all Terms of Use, Guidelines, or Codes of Conduct put in place by any service which Project Topaz uses for collaboration are incorporated into our rules. Examples of collaboration services include GitHub and Discord. Do not break the Terms of Use for such services, or violate any community guidelines while using that service.

The official GitHub [Terms of Use](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) and [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-community-guidelines) are incorporated into our rules.

Additionally, the official Discord [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines) are also incorporated into our rules.

Project Topaz will enforce violations against either set of Terms or Guidelines, regardless upon which service the violation occurs. 

# 2. Non-FFXI Topics
There are many places on the internet you can discuss sex, people's appearance, race, religion, cars, politics, and any other number of non-FFXI topics. This is not one of those places. We are not here to talk about what people believe about religion, who they vote for, or anything else that does not have to do specifically with FFXI. There are a million other places on the internet and in the rest of the world to discuss the other things - please go do so elsewhere.

# 3. Toxic Behavior
Project Topaz wants members of the private server community to feel welcome and valued. Therefore, the following toxic behaviors are unacceptable:

- Disparaging comments about individuals or groups
- "Jokes" involving sex, genitals, or sexual abuse
- Offensive memes or emojis
- Other unprofessional content that belittles, intimidates, or otherwise disrespects our members

We would rather have the new contributors be comfortable, and create a welcoming environment for everyone, than cater to people, however knowledgeable, who wish to denigrate and belittle others.

# 4. Welcoming Behavior
Community Members are expected to always conduct themselves in a manner that encourages contributions by others. This means that you should not:

- Insult people or code. Instead, provide gentle corrections and suggestions.
- Snap at a community member. Instead, step back to cool off, then later give a professional response.
- Bemoan additional work a contributor "causes". Instead, ask for help.
- Disparage efforts made by others. Instead, provide guidance.
- Disregard a person. Instead, find their value.

# 5. Community
Project Topaz feels that everyone has a role to play in working towards our shared love of emulating and preserving FFXI. Do not make disparaging comments, even in jest, about servers or other codebases. These only upset people who have worked hard on that server or codebase. You never know when someone from that server you mocked will want to contribute to us, but we will lose them when they see us insulting them behind their backs. Please treat members of other communities like they're one of our own, because they might be one day.

# 6. Dispute Resolution
Always work towards resolving disputes. Disagreements are to be expected. Behavior which amplifies them is not. While there will be times a dispute can not be resolved satisfactory to both parties, you should still do your best do so.

**Remember that everyone in our community is working towards a common goal.**
