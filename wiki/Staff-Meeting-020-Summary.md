# Opening Remarks
> Due to the consistent increase in the number of Pull Requests opened to Project Topaz, our Staff does not have the capacity to ensure that all Pull Requests are steadily reviewed on the "automatically merge if not held" schedule we have been holding to until now.

> While we do value all Pull Requests and do wish that we had the capacity to maintain such a system, our endeavor to do so with our current volume of Pull Requests has put undue pressure on Staff. This endeavor has also stalled development for Project Focuses, as Staff have been dedicating all of their time to Pull Request reviews to meet the scheduled times in which Pull Requests must be reviewed by.

> Therefore, it is with great regret that I state we will pause the process in which all Pull Requests are brought up for discussion during Staff meetings and decisions made to either hold or merge the Pull Request. Starting with this meeting, the only Pull Requests that will be brought up for discussion are those which have been reviewed.

> We are currently exploring new processes to ensure that community contributions are reviewed, improved, and accepted into the codebase. One such process is the establishment of recognized community reviewers - who are not Staff and will not have the powers of Staff - who have demonstrated their ability to thoroughly review submissions and assist Staff by making the review process easier. We will discuss such roles further during General Remarks.

> All opened Pull Requests which have not been reviewed will be listed in a new section of our meeting format - "Unreviewed Pull Requests". This section will ensure that Staff are reminded of these Pull Requests, and provide an easy list for community reviewers to see which Pull Requests our Staff might need assistance reviewing! I hope the addition of this section will provide Pull Request authors with sufficient confidence that they are not being ignored by the project.

> I wish to make it clear that we have no intention of letting any Pull Request languish for extended period without engagement by Project Topaz. We want everyone to feel involved in development! I will be watching how this decision affects contributions and community morale. If the health of project is negatively affected, we will pursue further revising or enact new processes to ensure a healthy contribution environment.

> Despite how exceptional our Staff may be, they are still only human - and unpaid volunteers at that! We thank you for your understanding.

# Closing Remarks
> On behalf of Project Topaz, I again apologize for the change in our review process. Moving forward we will seek to strike a balance to ensure that all community contributions are reviewed and accepted on a consistent schedule, while being mindful of the capacity that we currently have. We will explore revising our processes, and pursue new methods which may be suggested to us. I thank all contributors for their kindness and understanding in this matter.

> Community Members who wish to assist Project Topaz in a more directed capacity may send me a Direct Message if they are interested in obtaining the Developer, Tester, and Researcher role. We do not yet have a firmly established process for acquiring these roles, and we will seek to increase the amount of automation involved in the future.
