All of the current rates/weights follow the ffxiclopedia ones that are listed similar to whoever previously wrote these, as there does not seem to be any other websites available with weights/data. For now I just used the ffxiclopedia weights exactly, but I'm thinking that the rarity tiers probably all have the same rate applied to an item, rather than specific drop rates for each individual item -- similar to Treasure Hunter. If that's agreed upon I am more than willing to go back and update them.

I think so as well. Likely the case for many things too, maybe treasure chests/coffers and even H.E.L.M. But don’t know for sure. With enough _reliable_ data we could make a good guess maybe.
