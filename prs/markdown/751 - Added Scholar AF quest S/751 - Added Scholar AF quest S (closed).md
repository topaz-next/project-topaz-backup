Once the BCNM is in, this should be uncommented, as it consumes the transcript on cutscene finish.

At the end of the BCNM fight, this line should execute. I put it here because the BCNM isn't scripted. Once this is set, the quest will continue as I've written it.

Once the BCNM is in, this should be uncommented so the BCNM-teleportation cutscene can be triggered.
