Trusts were using monster-level weapon damage with no regard to their jobs. This is a quick patch to bring their weapon damage down and scale a bit around their jobs' default weapon. There are mods to adjust Excenmille and Naji's weapon damages since they don't use their jobs' default weapons.

NOTE: Currently only targets Trusts that are "available". Will be expanded in future PRs.
