usually yes. I dunno if its still on the table but there was this plan to phase out most of the mod tabling for monsters. Families were to migrate to mixins for theirs, spawns were to go in scripts, pool mods I wasn't clear on.

Chelv and that issue need other work. the titles for that and the older KB issue do not accurately reflect what is being asked for in them, which is a wish list of multiple fixes. Both should be closed and remade.
