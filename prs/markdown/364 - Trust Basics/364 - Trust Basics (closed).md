**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

This PR topaz-ifys @Omnione's PR (with their blessing) and allows trusts to be cast (but they don't do anything).

With contributions also from @Safhaven's Trust PR.

**GOAL:**
- Take the existing work of others and get it into topaz, so it isn't as daunting to start working on trusts.
- Put in basic plumbing, limit checking etc.

**DONE:**
`trustutils`, `CTrustEntity` and some misc trust changes in core
Bindings: `getTrustID` and `getPartyTrusts`, make `getPartyCount` more usable
Audit the mobpools and mob_spell_lists of all trusts, basic nation trusts have correct spell lists
`isValidHealTarget` helper in `magic.lua` to simplify checks going forward
`spell/trust` entries for a bunch of trusts, which are pretty much empty husks for now
`trust.lua` global with `tpz.trust.canCast` which handles:
- Rejecting casting if you're in an alliance
- Rejecting casting if you're not the party leader
- Rejecting you if you try to cast the same trust twice
- Rejecting you if you try to cast related trusts (See all the Shantotto spell/trust entries).
- Rejecting you if you push the party size above 6 (tested with multiple PCs, trusts and combinations thereof)
- Rejecting you if you try to cast more trusts than you have the ROV KI's for (easily removable)

Bindings for trust Spawn/Despawn/Die messages
Commands:  /returnfaith, /refa, /returntrust and /retr (+all) work 
Fix client crash on casting spells directly on trusts. (Seems hacky, but it's stable at least!)
Trusts despawn and die correctly, when you kill them, or when you die/zone
Trusts will wait for you to engage and start an enmity list before they run in and melee your target
Basic spellcasting if a trust has spells assigned in `mob_spell_lists.sql`

**Starter trust missions are being worked on in a branch off of this branch viewable here:**

This is returning nil here, and seems like it could be another misc flag added to the enum instead while leaving the duplicate check to the core before we trigger the casting check (its a different message anyway)

It occurs to me we may have the capitalization backwards. IIRC, the 1st field is going to be the script name, and the 2nd is the packet name for instanced objects. So the 2nd would have ‚Äúproper‚Äù name capitalization but no spaces per SE specifications while the first would go full lowercase to avoid posix problems that were run into ages ago (duplicates happened, and git on windows machines got confused)

I'm not going to require a solution this particular problem in this PR, but I'll probably want a better way a spell can check for valid entity types, prior to all spells being modified to add trusts to them. It's already a long `or` chain, and if I recall, Fellow branch added its own as well.

Bitflags and an SQL field, masks, I dunno, _something_...!

To quote my past self:
> we'll eventually need a validHealTarget which cuts:
(target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.PC or target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.MOB or target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.TRUST)
Out of every healing script, and also makes sure the trust is a valid target (some trusts can't be targeted with spells).

We can probably save ourselves some effort later by calling a globalized function from the trusts global:
```lua
function onMagicCastingCheck(caster, target, spell)
    local message = tpz.trust.castCheck(caster, spell)
    return message
end
```

This example has a local assignment and return because after the "basic" check, you can still check for "duplicate/distinct" trusts while in the spell script, if the "can cast" logic is taken out of core (see later).

Trusts are invalid in some areas where pets are (ex: Salvage), so Trusts will need their own misc flags.

The message is different, but I don't expect the message IDs to be added in this PR, so just noting it now~

(One benefit of making the check logic a global is that changing the message later should be a one-line edit so someone doesn't need to go through all the scripts.)

At the moment this is a call to core, but I think we'd be better served if we instead do "can cast" in lua. Core might need a few binds to check trust ID (if they aren't already there), but I believe all other checks can be done without involving core:
```lua
-- pseudo
tpz.trust.canCast = function(caster, spell)
    if not caster:canUseMisc(tpz.zoneMisc.TRUST) then
        return NO_TRUSTS_HERE_MSG
    end

    if not party leader then
        return NOT_LEADER_MSG
    end

    local num_pt, num_trusts
    for players in party do
        if member is trust then
            if member spell id is spell:getID() then
                return DUPLICATE_TRUST_MSG
            else
                num_trusts = num_trusts + 1
            end
        end
        num_pt = num_pt + 1
    end
    if num_pt >= 6 then
        return PT_FULL_MSG
    end
    if num_trusts >= 3 and not player has ROV KI then
        return TOO_MANY_TRUSTS_MSG
    end
end
```

We can also either table "trusts with the same name", or pass the "the other same-trust"'s ID into this call to check for it:
```lua
-- shantotto ii.lua
function onMagicCastingCheck(caster, target, spell)
    tpz.trust.canCast(caster, spell, shantotto_i_spell_id)
end

-- trust global
trust.canCast = function(caster, spell, duplicate_trust_id)
    if (member spell ID is spell:getID) or (member spell ID is duplicate_trust_id) then
        return DUPLICATE_TRUST_MSG
    end
end
```
This gets around core doing the "heuristic" checks based on name; just let lua handle it in the spell script itself~

We _could_ globalize this as well, into a `tpz.trust.spawn(caster, spell)`, which at the moment would just be:
```lua
    caster:spawnTrust(spell:getID())
```
But at least it'd be in a global place in case we need to make additions to onSpellCast behavior later. But I'll be honest and admit I'm currently drawing a blank on "global useful" additions that'd necessitate calling a trust global method from the spell script, instead of calling `caster:spawnTrust(spell:getID())` directly from the script.

Maybe buffing the trust if certain conditions are met? Global checks for current campaigns?

Things like "saying special messages based on other trusts in party", "advancing certain quests", and "attach certain AI" would probably need to be done at the individual script level though, so I'm uncertain how well a lua trust global for "onSpellCast" would work out.

Shantotto and Shantotto II still have their previously defined spell and skill list IDs; Shantotto looks the same, but it seems Shantotto II's spell list of 276 got taken.

Both of their skill list IDs were taken as well.

I realize now that I've never seen a trust have spellcasting interruptions other than being silenced. I'm not saying 100% it doesn't happen, just that I haven't seen it (because usually trusts don't move while they're casting). It may be hard to confirm though, as I think the only thing that'd cause a mid-spell trust to move would be knockback, and then the "at same location" check might be coming into play.

It may be late, but I'm a little confused here: shouldn't a check like this be done higher in the packet? We've already accessed targid and id at this point~

And are we sending out this packet when we _don't_ have a PTrust?

What's going on with the size change?

Since this query is pulling from multiple tables, could we make sure all columns are prepended with the source table it's coming from? And can we get the selections grouped by their source table? We've got columns from pools, then some from family, then more from pools.

You've already returned PTarget if it's a Trust up on 503; the check for validTargetFlags if the target is a trust never gets reached.

So here's where I say that trusts can't be summoned while in an alliance.

_But_, if it's possible for core to handle trusts in alliances without creating additional overhead or other issues, I would personally be willing to overlook trust compatibility with alliances so long as any `canCast` function rejects the attempt by default~

as an example, a "taru" trust should simply use family ID 153 or 154 (or make a new one if those stats don't match)

shouldn't you just make `PTrust->GetSLevel()` a variable like you did for mainjob's level to avoid all these repeat calls?

Mainly to everyone, not necessarily you, Zach:
I'm _okay_ with these new scripts for now as a testing bed, but we're going to have to come up with _some_ solution to trusts having all the same abilities that players do! The last thing I want is additional burden to maintain an additional copy of weaponskills.

I'm thinking that during the "set up abilities" portion of this trust project we may want to consider reserving an entire block for trust skill lists so that they're all together. Not going to worry about it right now though~

And in the future, we might also want to make sure that any skills "added" for trusts are the same IDs as captured from retail (and that the skill list uses the right one). According to the Windower resource database, there's three different copies of Provoke in monster_abilities.

You probably recognize this, Zach, so this is mainly for others:

Trust AI will need quite a bit of work to implement some new systems. As examples, cooldowns should be handled by the entity itself, and available weaponskills should be provided by core upon spawn based on skill lists and the trust's level. What's currently here is probably testing to make sure trusts are able to use abilities alright and that listeners work, rather than being a finalized AI.

I'm okay with these limited placeholders being in for merge (so people working on the branch can see a couple trusts in action for testing), but please no one start copy-pasting for all tank trusts and then open a PR~ üòÖ

Checking if the topEnmity is the master might not work if the master isn't the tank, and checking if it's not null would cause trusts to engage before the master has hit the mob. Maybe check to see if the master has it as their claimed mob?

Although, that will still run into issues if the mob was claimed by JA or MA. We might end up needing a "has smacked" üò¶

I think retail somehow forms a line based off of the master's last position, in that trusts spawn "behind" you, and then behind other trusts. Although it's been a while since I've last watched how they spawn, and this is very clearly "for later", because it's not important.

Wiki is similarly confused for Iroha, listing her as SAM on the main page, but weirdly BLM/SAM on her specific page. It also lists her ROV version as WHM/SAM on its individual page, instead of SAM/WHM as it does on the main category listing.

The current movement code works about 70% of the time, every time. They do tend to form up like an actual party, but there are still instances of them getting stuck away from the mob, jostling for position, getting trapped by a wall of other trusts and being unable to get to the enemy etc.

Unfortunately not, there is a gap in 1000-1003, so the ID's don't all line up perfectly with their position in TrustList. This can be simplified into `std::find`, I'd rather a search than an if/else for the regions either side of the gap

Don't forget the weapon type in the core for mobs is currently bs, and that field controls if a mob double swings or not. IIRC hume ark angel dual wields. So you'd have to set his type "wrong" here to get correct behavior in that case.

@ibm2431 Mobs, pets, and trusts don't obey those rules so that won't come into play at all. Whatever the pool value says they should do, they will do at any level.

And on retail trusts that dual wield will do so at any level afaik (I haven't seen any example to the contrary).

This is returning nil here, and seems like it could be another misc flag added to the enum instead while leaving the duplicate check to the core before we trigger the casting check (its a different message anyway)

It occurs to me we may have the capitalization backwards. IIRC, the 1st field is going to be the script name, and the 2nd is the packet name for instanced objects. So the 2nd would have ‚Äúproper‚Äù name capitalization but no spaces per SE specifications while the first would go full lowercase to avoid posix problems that were run into ages ago (duplicates happened, and git on windows machines got confused)

I'm not going to require a solution this particular problem in this PR, but I'll probably want a better way a spell can check for valid entity types, prior to all spells being modified to add trusts to them. It's already a long `or` chain, and if I recall, Fellow branch added its own as well.

Bitflags and an SQL field, masks, I dunno, _something_...!

To quote my past self:
> we'll eventually need a validHealTarget which cuts:
(target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.PC or target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.MOB or target:getObjType() == dsp.objType.TRUST)
Out of every healing script, and also makes sure the trust is a valid target (some trusts can't be targeted with spells).

We can probably save ourselves some effort later by calling a globalized function from the trusts global:
```lua
function onMagicCastingCheck(caster, target, spell)
    local message = tpz.trust.castCheck(caster, spell)
    return message
end
```

This example has a local assignment and return because after the "basic" check, you can still check for "duplicate/distinct" trusts while in the spell script, if the "can cast" logic is taken out of core (see later).

The message is different, but I don't expect the message IDs to be added in this PR, so just noting it now~

(One benefit of making the check logic a global is that changing the message later should be a one-line edit so someone doesn't need to go through all the scripts.)

At the moment this is a call to core, but I think we'd be better served if we instead do "can cast" in lua. Core might need a few binds to check trust ID (if they aren't already there), but I believe all other checks can be done without involving core:
```lua
-- pseudo
tpz.trust.canCast = function(caster, spell)
    if not caster:canUseMisc(tpz.zoneMisc.TRUST) then
        return NO_TRUSTS_HERE_MSG
    end

    if not party leader then
        return NOT_LEADER_MSG
    end

    local num_pt, num_trusts
    for players in party do
        if member is trust then
            if member spell id is spell:getID() then
                return DUPLICATE_TRUST_MSG
            else
                num_trusts = num_trusts + 1
            end
        end
        num_pt = num_pt + 1
    end
    if num_pt >= 6 then
        return PT_FULL_MSG
    end
    if num_trusts >= 3 and not player has ROV KI then
        return TOO_MANY_TRUSTS_MSG
    end
end
```

We can also either table "trusts with the same name", or pass the "the other same-trust"'s ID into this call to check for it:
```lua
-- shantotto ii.lua
function onMagicCastingCheck(caster, target, spell)
    tpz.trust.canCast(caster, spell, shantotto_i_spell_id)
end

-- trust global
trust.canCast = function(caster, spell, duplicate_trust_id)
    if (member spell ID is spell:getID) or (member spell ID is duplicate_trust_id) then
        return DUPLICATE_TRUST_MSG
    end
end
```
This gets around core doing the "heuristic" checks based on name; just let lua handle it in the spell script itself~

We _could_ globalize this as well, into a `tpz.trust.spawn(caster, spell)`, which at the moment would just be:
```lua
    caster:spawnTrust(spell:getID())
```
But at least it'd be in a global place in case we need to make additions to onSpellCast behavior later. But I'll be honest and admit I'm currently drawing a blank on "global useful" additions that'd necessitate calling a trust global method from the spell script, instead of calling `caster:spawnTrust(spell:getID())` directly from the script.

Maybe buffing the trust if certain conditions are met? Global checks for current campaigns?

Things like "saying special messages based on other trusts in party", "advancing certain quests", and "attach certain AI" would probably need to be done at the individual script level though, so I'm uncertain how well a lua trust global for "onSpellCast" would work out.

I realize now that I've never seen a trust have spellcasting interruptions other than being silenced. I'm not saying 100% it doesn't happen, just that I haven't seen it (because usually trusts don't move while they're casting). It may be hard to confirm though, as I think the only thing that'd cause a mid-spell trust to move would be knockback, and then the "at same location" check might be coming into play.

Since this query is pulling from multiple tables, could we make sure all columns are prepended with the source table it's coming from? And can we get the selections grouped by their source table? We've got columns from pools, then some from family, then more from pools.

So here's where I say that trusts can't be summoned while in an alliance.

_But_, if it's possible for core to handle trusts in alliances without creating additional overhead or other issues, I would personally be willing to overlook trust compatibility with alliances so long as any `canCast` function rejects the attempt by default~

Mainly to everyone, not necessarily you, Zach:
I'm _okay_ with these new scripts for now as a testing bed, but we're going to have to come up with _some_ solution to trusts having all the same abilities that players do! The last thing I want is additional burden to maintain an additional copy of weaponskills.

And in the future, we might also want to make sure that any skills "added" for trusts are the same IDs as captured from retail (and that the skill list uses the right one). According to the Windower resource database, there's three different copies of Provoke in monster_abilities.

You probably recognize this, Zach, so this is mainly for others:

Trust AI will need quite a bit of work to implement some new systems. As examples, cooldowns should be handled by the entity itself, and available weaponskills should be provided by core upon spawn based on skill lists and the trust's level. What's currently here is probably testing to make sure trusts are able to use abilities alright and that listeners work, rather than being a finalized AI.

I'm okay with these limited placeholders being in for merge (so people working on the branch can see a couple trusts in action for testing), but please no one start copy-pasting for all tank trusts and then open a PR~ üòÖ

Checking if the topEnmity is the master might not work if the master isn't the tank, and checking if it's not null would cause trusts to engage before the master has hit the mob. Maybe check to see if the master has it as their claimed mob?

Although, that will still run into issues if the mob was claimed by JA or MA. We might end up needing a "has smacked" üò¶

I think retail somehow forms a line based off of the master's last position, in that trusts spawn "behind" you, and then behind other trusts. Although it's been a while since I've last watched how they spawn, and this is very clearly "for later", because it's not important.

Wiki is similarly confused for Iroha, listing her as SAM on the main page, but weirdly BLM/SAM on her specific page. It also lists her ROV version as WHM/SAM on its individual page, instead of SAM/WHM as it does on the main category listing.

The current movement code works about 70% of the time, every time. They do tend to form up like an actual party, but there are still instances of them getting stuck away from the mob, jostling for position, getting trapped by a wall of other trusts and being unable to get to the enemy etc.

Unfortunately not, there is a gap in 1000-1003, so the ID's don't all line up perfectly with their position in TrustList. This can be simplified into `std::find`, I'd rather a search than an if/else for the regions either side of the gap

Don't forget the weapon type in the core for mobs is currently bs, and that field controls if a mob double swings or not. IIRC hume ark angel dual wields. So you'd have to set his type "wrong" here to get correct behavior in that case.

@ibm2431 Mobs, pets, and trusts don't obey those rules so that won't come into play at all. Whatever the pool value says they should do, they will do at any level.

And on retail trusts that dual wield will do so at any level afaik (I haven't seen any example to the contrary).

Well, sometimes you want to pull the mob away from others without your trusts running forward to plant themselves in the middle of danger!

I think a happy medium might be a GM command.

Merging master into a feature branch might pose problems when it comes time to merge the finished feature into stable - all the unrelated commits in master would becoming too~ üòÖ

Commits from Omnione were originally based off of sidestream, changing Shantotto's file here threw merge conflicts with our master, one thing led to another, and I felt a straight up rebase off of our current master was in order.

I know how it looks, but I didn't _want_ to attach my name to those commits, I swear!

@TeoTwawki I had a look in `adventuringfellow` and I see how it's _meant_ to be done, I'll whip all of the fake PT chat out and leave it for my next PR üëç

@zach2good just a heads up when you get there, he used showText and it should be messageSpecial - showText is just wrapping messageSpecial to add a few additional things (things which neither fellows nor trusts will need)

After addressing some points from IBM's review, I thought it might be useful to write up some of my choices about this PR for newcomers to this PR (if there are any):

**The crux of this entire PR:**
The packet logic change in `magic_state.cpp`. I don't know if this is correct, I found this while desperately wrestling with the client crash there. It works, it's stable and I haven't noticed any strangeness.

**Design decisions:**
I wanted Core to be totally unrestricted, and any restrictions to exist in Lua. The Lua restricts things down to a retail-like experience, but if operators wanted to clear out all of the restrictions in `tpz.trust.canCast`, there's nothing stopping them:
- Having trusts in Jeuno
- An alliance full of trusts
- 22 Shantottos nuking things

Trusts are "kind of" treated like party members. I've added `ForPartyWithTrusts` and `:getPartyWithTrusts` for anything that might need to iterate over the party including trusts. I did experiment with treating them as full members, but there were all sorts of explosions with Latents, `OnMobDeathEx`, etc. so I skirted around it.

**Magic, Skills and AI:**
What I've put in at the moment is just a fun frame that allows you to play with a party of Kupipi, Naji and Shantotto.
