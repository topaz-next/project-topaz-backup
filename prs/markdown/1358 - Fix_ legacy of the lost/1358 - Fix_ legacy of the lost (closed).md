_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1358_

----

Currently the legacy of the lost bcnm can be entered with anyone who is currently on the mission and anyone who is in the party will be skipped ahead to the next mission on a win. This at least puts a check on battlefield win for the credit, but does not address people being able to join on a lesser mission.

you probably get the title even if just helping, so we should probably move the mission check to a conditional inside the csid check and then put the mission progression commands inside that
