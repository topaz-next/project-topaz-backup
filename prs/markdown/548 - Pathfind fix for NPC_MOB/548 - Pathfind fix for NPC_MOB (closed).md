_Wednesday Apr 29, 2020 at 22:55:33_
_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 548_

----

â€¢ Addition of npcBasicPath to pathfind.lua, this pathfind function requires paths to be set in a linear fashion like this example
local path =
{
    [1] = {1.000, 2.000, 3.000},
    [2] = {2.000, 2.000, 3.000},
    [3] = {3.000, 2.000, 3.000},
    [4] = {2.000, 2.000, 3.000}
}
This way the path returns to the origin from the last path point to the first, i.e a circle.
the npcBasicPath will keep track of what path point the npc is on by the newly added m_pathPoint in npcentity.

â€¢ As stated above i have added a m_pathPoint to npcentity and given the the entity a getter and setter to help keep track of the npc's path.

â€¢ Adjusted Novalmauge's script to reflect the changes.

He's walk animation still seems a bit buggy but its about as good as i could get it.
But atleast it shouldn't crash the server anymore.
 
This should fix the following bug
Novalmauge causes server crash due to pathing. #493

In either case, the table keys aren't needed; Lua will internally give un-keyed elements an increasing integer representation ðŸ˜‰

Thoughts of baking this into `initNpcAi`? Can make it take a table, grab the first point while in core, set the pos, and also potentially take a walking speed as well to set as a local var.

If all paroling NPCs use this new method, will `npc:wait()` still have a use? Should we consider changing the internals of `:wait()` to essentially set speed to 0? (Would pathing need to be stopped?)

If we need to keep `npc:wait()`, should there be a wrapper like `tpz.path.pause()`?

If the "new" initNpcAi (which has a commented TODO to change the name) ends up setting a local var to the NPC, then could add a `tpz.path.resume()` which sets the speed back and calls `npcBasicPath`

opinion: wait() does a lot of things besides stopping movement, it stops all the stuff and things. because of that its tempting to use it for a lot of situations that result in crashes. wait should be removed from its use in pathing scripts, but may have future use for..something.. 

could we possibly cause the event triggering core side to set the entities speed to 0 and then the event finish to restore it to its original value? :thinking: `m_event.Target` appears to be the npc in the core.

I was not aware of this - we can make event starts accurate! (On retail, the packet is the initiating NPC, but we've always invoked it directly as the "player" being the initiator)

I'm not really sure where to go with this but as we now have pathStop() and pathResume(), we will no longer get crashes when interacting with an npc that uses pathing, i think i found and converted all npc's that use pathing to use the new pathing systems.

i did change the name of initNpcAI to initNpcPathing and you can now call it as npc:initNpcPathing() or pass an x,y,z to set the start position so npc:initNpcPathing(x,y,z) and also it will set the path point to 1 as default, but you can pass a 4th param to set the point also so npc:initNpcPathing(x, y, z, 5) will set the position and set the starting path point to 5.

all tables that use the new system should now be a simple point i.e. {10, 10, 10} with additional extra params able to be passed if required.

Why not store the original speed in a localVar instead of re-querying the database?
You can actually get and set localVars from the C++ side too, not just in lua.

For NPCs we could try having the event code itself stop and restart NPC movement. since `m_event.target` is the NPC entity itself. Mobs we'd still need a script command for stop/start.

`m_PBaseEntity->speed = 0;` actually does work, no need to recast as a battleentity for either mobs or npc's (or players). Which makes this entire function in its current form a duplicate of `speed()`

Lets improve it by having this function also store the entities current speed to a localVar prior to setting it zero. Then resume path can read that value instead of querying the database every time.

```c++
 m_PBaseEntity->SetLocalVar(lua_tostring(L, 1), (uint64_t)lua_tointeger(L, 2));
```

all tables that use the new system should now be a simple point i.e. {10, 10, 10} with additional extra params able to be passed if required.

Looking at this "in the wild", I wonder if `general` is really the right name for the default, regular, general call?

Now that I say the other options, I guess it's as good as all the others ðŸ¤·

I hope you were able to automate this process and didn't have to manage all these tables by hand...

Maybe refactor to `tpz.pathing.path()`, I don't know how much work that would be?

Why not store the original speed in a localVar instead of re-querying the database?
You can actually get and set localVars from the C++ side too, not just in lua.

For NPCs we could try having the event code itself stop and restart NPC movement. since `m_event.target` is the NPC entity itself. Mobs we'd still need a script command for stop/start.

`m_PBaseEntity->speed = 0;` actually does work, no need to recast as a battleentity for either mobs or npc's (or players). Which makes this entire function in its current form a duplicate of `speed()`

Lets improve it by having this function also store the entities current speed to a localVar prior to setting it zero. Then resume path can read that value instead of querying the database every time.

```c++
 m_PBaseEntity->SetLocalVar(lua_tostring(L, 1), (uint64_t)lua_tointeger(L, 2));
```

not particularly no. I'd rather see it be changed here and its such a small correction to make instead of unnecessarily adding more iops of our inefficient db connection.

I think you've taken care of all semicolons and random things in Lua, but if you could take a merge of release just to be sure that would be grand
