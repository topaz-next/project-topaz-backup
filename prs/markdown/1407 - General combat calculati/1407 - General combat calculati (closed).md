_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1407_

----

Too much changed to go into detail here. I have summarized changes in each commit and my code is packed full of comments and links to references and research.

Super short summary: 
Updated battleutils and summon.lua with equations for pDIF, fSTR, Hit Rate, Level Correction.
I have updated the base weapon computation for avatars.
I have updated how crit rate from dex works.
Level correction is not computed for newer zones/content since the release of SoA.
Some minor bug fixes.

Note: I have not updated the BP damage equations and plan to tackle those in the future, likely one avatar per PR or maybe even one BP per PR.

Note: I have not added the Damage Limit+ trait or "Physical Damage +%" to the computations as I do not believe the project supports them yet. I have noted how they were and where they need to be added once they are implemented.

This cast can still produce `nullptr`, which will get used by `targ_weapon->isTwoHanded();` later, you can change that to:
`bool isTwoHanded = targ_weapon && targ_weapon->isTwoHanded();` to make it safe

Floats should be marked as `0.0f` or else they'll be created as doubles and then converted. I'm sure the compiler probably handles this, but better to be clear

Same here, you're going to be using `targ_weapon` later and there isn't a guarantee that it'll be populated, so either bail all of those checks if this is nullptr or put a nullptr check inline with each of those down below

Problem with the `finaldmg < targetHP` check is that `AvatarPhysicalMove` is called _before_ defense adjustments for the defender `AvatarFinalAdjustments`, which can cause these cycles to break out early under the assumption the mob will be dead.

I know this was here before, but waking up targets is now baked into lua_baseentity:takeDamage(); you can remove it from the raw damage calculation step.

lol sure I'll add it, I left out the link because I'd been linking to pDIF so often. I thought I was safe!
I would agree with a zone flag, the first place I looked was the DB to see if there was any flag per expansion and or anything else I could use. Luckily they're all clumped together except for Legion A

Sure, I'll fix these today üëç 
Just to be clear on the thread name: "General combat calculation improvements for Avatars"
This will impact players as well, I started with the summon.lua but then that drifted into the general combat equations for the melee hits.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help regarding avatars or if there's anything you'd prefer to have prioritized. My next plan was to move onto blood pact equations including modifiers. I have been collecting some Pet: DEX+/STR+ gear for math stuff on retail.

I honestly know nothing about combat balancing and rely on the others for sanity checking, but if you continue testing things and documenting your sources, we'll have all of that available when someone "fixes" avatars üëç
