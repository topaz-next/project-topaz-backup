Early this year, I had a player unable to find geyser lizard, and I couldn't find him or understand where he was in my ffxi dev infancy either.  Lusiphur just brought to my attention how incorrect his spawn coordinates were in the NM_spawn_points.sql.  New spawn locations provided by Lusi, thank you <3

For 100% exact locations, we'd need capture data.
