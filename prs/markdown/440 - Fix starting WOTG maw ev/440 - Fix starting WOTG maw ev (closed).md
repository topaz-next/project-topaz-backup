_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 440_

----

Client expects a param for these events and will hang if it doesn't get them. Params were in the original maw files, but got lost during the teleport refactor. Batallia's maw has been working this whole time due to the client expecting a param of zero for that zone, but Sauromuge and Rolanberry have not.
