Note to our future selves: Change this list name to something more descriptive, like... 'Tenzen' ðŸ˜‰ 

edit: And there are a _lot_ of pools using this skill list ID which _I don't think they should_. I think this might have been some catch-all skill list ID for all unimplemented humanoid mob pools.

iI think its a leftover from back when using a ton of checks in the onMobSkillCheck to figure our _which_ mob it was, was being allowed instead of just making a new list.

skill lists and family IDs used to be same thing, which lead to a lot of dumb decisions back then
