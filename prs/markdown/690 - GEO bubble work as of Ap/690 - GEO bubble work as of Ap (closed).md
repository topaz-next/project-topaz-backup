_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 690_

----

This is #494 , but rebased on current release (ie: with SQL already merge), and limited to only as of the end of April; without the additional spell bubbles, -ara spells, job abilities, etc. (In other words at [the point when I was mostly okay with merging to start a new branch](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/494#issuecomment-621176083))

This will let us rebase/retarget #494 and better see what was added after April, and then begin splitting up and reviewing the out-of-scope GEO stuff that goes beyond the original bubble implementation.

I had sole hold on the _original_ Pull Request. We never determined what happens when PRs are split -- or when more stuff is added after a hold -- but _this_ PR is work that was done prior to my hold, so I'll go ahead and hit the merge button...!
