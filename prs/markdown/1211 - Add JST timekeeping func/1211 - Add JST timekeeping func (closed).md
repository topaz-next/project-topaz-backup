_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1211_

----

This adds functions to retrieve JST-based time. It is agnostic to the local timezone setting, only expecting the clock be set correctly for their own local timezone.

Should greatly help PR #914

Looks good, I just have one question about the JST midnight function. Am I reading it right that it returns last midnight instead of next midnight? I only ask because the Lua midnight function returns next midnight so there might be some confusion.

It returns the upcoming midnight. However, the easiest way to calculate that is to calculate the previous midnight and add 1 day.

Thanks for the catch, I didn't notice the comment!
I'm fixing it along with the Win32 builds. :unamused:

> I was getting myself all prepared to question your use of `static` until I saw that `time_server` is just a standalone function getting called from the `taskmanager`. Ew. Good call laughing

I love statics when the case is right.<3 
The fact that all the other categories still use class variables unnecessarily still irks me to no end, but :shrug:

Guild patterns are hard coded in the client to use JST midnight, and since that's the only thing using midnight it might be worth it to just get rid of that block and call the guild update in the new JST midnight block, I think it only requires 2 changes in guildutils.cpp from `getSysYearDay` to `getJstYearDay`.

You could close two PRs with this... if you get my drift

if @jarmengaud is fine with me usurping his PR, I'll move the line up and trash the system local midnight block.
