Bard song choice logic doesn't exist yet, so Joachim always sings the same two songs.
I don't understand SCH yet, so Adelheid doesn't do anything special.
Adelheid's TP moves aren't programmed - so they don't work.
Ranged Attacks don't work yet, so Joachim won't throw rocks.
Mihli's Bubbles TP move is programmed yet, so she won't use it.
Fixed an issue where Trusts using "random" WSs wouldn't be able to use their best one.


**Remember that these exist in an experimental feature branch and the canary testing branch. If you're expecting balance or stability - you will be sorely disappointed.**

That being said; Enjoy!

He resides in a glass mog house you see, so his moogle took all his pebbles for safety concerns.
