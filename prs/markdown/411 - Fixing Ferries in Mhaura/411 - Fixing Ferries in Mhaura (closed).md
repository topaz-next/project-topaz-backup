_Thursday Mar 12, 2020 at 04:53:24_
_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 411_

----

* Offset was wrong and time at dock was also wrong. This was fixed.
* Issue with docking position for Ferries is still wrong, but pos in table is now retail accurate.
* NPC at dock in Mhaura now moves when ferry arrives and departs, also tells you about it,
not 100% retail accurate as it needs to rotate when it reaches final location. Leaving it as a TODO
for someone else to complete it.

Can probably shorten these; they're already in the `tpz.transport` namespace, so `Porter` is already implied. ðŸ˜‰

tpz.transport.trigger.mhaura
tpz.transport.offset.mhaura

Here's a trick you could do to save some lines and space, since your "arriving" and "departing" are all even/odd:

```lua
if (triggerID % 2) == 0 then
    npc:pathThrough(-- arriving)
else
    npc:pathThrough(-- departing)
end
```

Not going to force you to globalize this _juuusstt_ yet, but you can save yourself a little effort later by:
```lua
tpz.transport.messages = {}
tpz.transport.messages.mhaura = function(npc, triggerID, messages)
```

(Later we can extend this to instead be just one function which takes a `dock`, and then pulls the appropriate tables based on the dock, but I realize right now that the focus is to fix the ferry)

And then your function call down here becomes: `tpz.transport.messages.mhaura(npc, triggerID, messages)`

~~Developer: I _was_ going to have this target the `transport` branch, but the commit history did _not_ like that, so I punted back to `release`. I'll have to see what's going on with the `transport` branch later.~~

`transport` is just quite a ways behind `release`, which is what this was based on.
