Be back at the PC in a min
mrmclawToday at 12:47 PM
If you are able to find one with the same stat level
I can link the number to the other job
ApocaIypseToday at 12:57 PM
same STR and MND as MNK
same AGI as THF
same DEX and VIT as RDM
same CHR and INT as NIN
surprised how bad RUN's VIT is
mrmclawToday at 1:00 PM
Yeah, thats painful
Uhm, How about hp/mp ?
Sorry to ask ; ;
If I grab the equivalent numbers, doy uo want to submit the pr since you did most the work or shall i?
ApocaIypseToday at 1:02 PM

ApocaIypseToday at 1:05 PM

clopedia is great at old content, bgwiki is... unreliable period
