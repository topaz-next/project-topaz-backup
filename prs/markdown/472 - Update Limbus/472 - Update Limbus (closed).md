_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 472_

----

- Adjust entry requirements.
- Overhaul limbus.lua.
- Update Limbus NPCs.
- Rewrite armoury crate handling.
- Table Limbus mob/npc IDs.
- Move soap timer from Sagheera.
- Extend pathTo to accept pathflags.
- Add special setup for Limbus mobs.

Note that none of the actual BCNM or mob files are adjusted here, and all zones have been locked to prevent entry.

No need to click or identify these, just using the IDs to set animation for doors.

charVars default to zero if they're not set; I'm still diving into this, but if you're using this later to determine where players should end up, it may present undesired behavior (because later `getCharVar` calls will return 0 when they fail to find a var)

Doesn't have to be done now, but we may want to consider a new zoneType for such zones in the future. I think there's a handful more than just Limbus.

Did this originally and you're probably right. I think this function needs some work anyway (should _any_ bcnm mobs be giving direct exp from kills, for example?)

I had this stuff in loops originally, but it was too slow and allowed opening multiple chests by timing correctly or spamming. Some floors change the chest model dynamically.

This is a weird one, and it may not matter, but all 3 of these zones have different crate mechanics. East has 4 chests and if you get a mimic then there's weird mechanics there, the others have 3. West doesn't depop the other chests, and North has 3 chests and you can only pick 1.
