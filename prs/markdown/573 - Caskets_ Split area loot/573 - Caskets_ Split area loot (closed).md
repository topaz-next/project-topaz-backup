previously left out from a mistake on a rebase.

Only thing I think might be improved on is defining these zones as a Set in the caskets global:
```lua
casketInfo.splitZones = set{
    tpz.zone.ZERUHN_MINES,
    tpz.zone.KORROLOKA_TUNNEL
}
```

And then your check here becomes:
`if casketInfo.splitZones[zoneId] then`

And with a Set already defined, the same check can be used here too: `if casketInfo.splitZones[zoneId] then`
