- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date

I am opening as a Pull Request to test Travis and AppVeyor again.

When removing previous branding, I inadvertently introduced illegal symbols into the make file. My machine is Windows, and the solution has been building, so I did not notice until testing Travis. This has been corrected.
