_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 545_

----

Currently a WIP. Only thing ready is Lathuya's logic. I need to verify that the order of the quest is correct, also one thing i am having issues is the zone:registerRegion and onZoneIn for it as i just added a testing print to player to make sure that the area is correct and i do not get any feedback.

The very _first_ divination for Waoud during Transformations is 720. The hint during the first stage (ie: progress == 1) is event 721.

Will it be possible to speak to Waoud after Transformations was accepted but _without_ being on stage 2? If not, can eliminate the stage check and only see if it's been accepted.

You can use npcUtil.popFromQM to spawn the soulflayer and lock out the spawn point so that other people can't use the QM to spawn a second soulflayer (and forcibly despawning one that might be up).

If using popFromQM to spawn the soulflayer, you won't need to check to see if the soulflayer is spawned, because the QM won't be available to interact with~!

I'm also not finding a source that the two CSes leading up to the soulflayer are optional~ ðŸ˜…

You might want an outer-wrapping if check for all this logic to see if the player is on or has completed Transformations ðŸ˜‰ 

Or alternatively: Check if a "remaining AF" is >= 1.

Checking that currentTask isn't 0 might be a good idea too~

Let's pop a charVar for `[BLUAF]Remaining` here, with a value of 7. Then we can use it as a "reverse mask" that the player will eventually set to 0 (and clear from the db).

Let's do server admins some favors and standardize the vars to all start with something like `[BLUAF]` so they can be found in one spot

`[BLUAF]Current`, `[BLUAF]Payment`, `[BLUAF]Resting`

Then after you give the item, you can check if `[BLUAF]Remaining` is 0. If it is, you can delete _all_ BLU AF associated variables (like Resting Day), so there are _zero_ vars leftover when a BLU has finished crafting all their items.

Shorter alternative:
```lua
if option >= 2 and option <= 9 then
    local updateType = option % 3
    if updateType == 2 then
        -- Choosing a piece
        local piece = 2 ^ math.floor(option / 4)
        -- Make sure the player isn't trying to cheat somehow
        if bit.band(piece, player:getCharVar("[BLUAF]Remaining")) > 0 then
            player:setCharVar("[BLUAF]Current", 2 ^ piece)
            player:updateEvent(0, craftingItems[currentTask][1], craftingItems[currentTask][2], craftingItems[currentTask][3], craftingItems[currentTask][4])
        end
    else
        -- Needs payment
        player:updateEvent(0, craftingItems[currentTask][5], craftingItems[currentTask][6])

This is equivalent to checking if  `current task > 1`~

Then `[BLUAF]Available` could be set to `[BLUAF]Available - (2 ^ (currentTask - 1))`

(Or: You wouldn't need a "positive-oriented" list of things you've crafted, because you instead have a "negative-oriented" list of things remaining to _be_ crafted)

This would mean adjusting the final piece to have a key of 3 in your craftingItems table (so all the pieces / tasks line up). I want to say this shouldn't be a problem, as `LathuyaCraftingList_Mask` seems to only be used as a table key (and mask bit manipulation which we're changing), and isn't used for any CS or param offsets (you already calculate those based on the total number of pieces crafted).

no cause they are not completed in order, if you complete the the 1st and 2nd item then it will result in 7- 1 - 2 = 4
if you complete the 1st and 3rd item then it will be 7 - 1 - 4 =  2
if you complete the 2nd and 3rd it will be 7 - 2 - 4 = 1
then depending on that it will pass the 1st 2nd or 3rd options (sorry i don't make sense explaining here but we can get on a video call and i can explain better)

Oh, because `craftedPieces` is the pieces crafted, not `totalCraftedPieces`.

"it depends"

If the check was done to _start_ the event, then a recheck on eventFinish is redundant (ie: quest progress before firing event). A player can't cheat an event start.

But if the initial startEvent _didn't_ require a certain check, and the check only becomes relevant due to a player's choice during it, then that thing should be checked onFinish before messing with it (ie: gil). A player _can_ cheat an option choice.

You can save two lines by setting msg to be `SKILL_NO_EFFECT` right here when you define it, and then override it down below if dispel > 0.

You can use npcUtil.popFromQM to spawn the soulflayer and lock out the spawn point so that other people can't use the QM to spawn a second soulflayer (and forcibly despawning one that might be up).

If using popFromQM to spawn the soulflayer, you won't need to check to see if the soulflayer is spawned, because the QM won't be available to interact with~!

I'm also not finding a source that the two CSes leading up to the soulflayer are optional~ ðŸ˜…

You might want an outer-wrapping if check for all this logic to see if the player is on or has completed Transformations ðŸ˜‰ 

Or alternatively: Check if a "remaining AF" is >= 1.

Checking that currentTask isn't 0 might be a good idea too~

Let's pop a charVar for `[BLUAF]Remaining` here, with a value of 7. Then we can use it as a "reverse mask" that the player will eventually set to 0 (and clear from the db).

Let's do server admins some favors and standardize the vars to all start with something like `[BLUAF]` so they can be found in one spot

`[BLUAF]Current`, `[BLUAF]Payment`, `[BLUAF]Resting`

Then after you give the item, you can check if `[BLUAF]Remaining` is 0. If it is, you can delete _all_ BLU AF associated variables (like Resting Day), so there are _zero_ vars leftover when a BLU has finished crafting all their items.

Shorter alternative:

        local piece = 2 ^ math.floor(option / 4)
        -- Make sure the player isn't trying to cheat somehow
        if bit.band(piece, player:getCharVar("[BLUAF]Remaining")) > 0 then
            player:setCharVar("[BLUAF]Current", 2 ^ piece)
            player:updateEvent(0, craftingItems[currentTask][1], craftingItems[currentTask][2], craftingItems[currentTask][3], craftingItems[currentTask][4])

This is equivalent to checking if  `current task > 1`~

Then `[BLUAF]Available` could be set to `[BLUAF]Available - (2 ^ (currentTask - 1))`

(Or: You wouldn't need a "positive-oriented" list of things you've crafted, because you instead have a "negative-oriented" list of things remaining to _be_ crafted)

This would mean adjusting the final piece to have a key of 3 in your craftingItems table (so all the pieces / tasks line up). I want to say this shouldn't be a problem, as `LathuyaCraftingList_Mask` seems to only be used as a table key (and mask bit manipulation which we're changing), and isn't used for any CS or param offsets (you already calculate those based on the total number of pieces crafted).

no cause they are not completed in order, if you complete the the 1st and 2nd item then it will result in 7- 1 - 2 = 4
if you complete the 1st and 3rd item then it will be 7 - 1 - 4 =  2
if you complete the 2nd and 3rd it will be 7 - 2 - 4 = 1
then depending on that it will pass the 1st 2nd or 3rd options (sorry i don't make sense explaining here but we can get on a video call and i can explain better)

"it depends"

If the check was done to _start_ the event, then a recheck on eventFinish is redundant (ie: quest progress before firing event). A player can't cheat an event start.

But if the initial startEvent _didn't_ require a certain check, and the check only becomes relevant due to a player's choice during it, then that thing should be checked onFinish before messing with it (ie: gil). A player _can_ cheat an option choice.

It looks like the order is always Caedarva Mire exit -> Mt Zhayolm exit. Currently both of these can be skipped the way char vars are being checked at the QM and NM.

I'm done with the quest :cat: 

Only thing missing are:
* 2 mob attacks for the NM that are missing, there were 3 missing attacks before but added one weird one that removes all buffs lol.
* correct location params for onRegionEnter for both optional cutscenes. Since they were options i didn't think it was really a stopped.

Now I'm at the mercy of a review. Please @UynGH @59blargedy remove the WIP tag and change it to ready for review :cat2:

Pushed a commit to flip the "orientation" of the charVars for AF crafting to start at max and go towards zero, making sure all associated vars are gone when the player has crafted all the AF pieces.

And I tested it too! I have made sure that my changes didn't break kain's code and cause this to happen:

Pushed a second commit for various fixes and cleanup, including the Undersea regions and CSes. Had to rework Waoud and Whitegate a little after trying them as non-BLU and naked (respectively) caused unexpected behavior.

I set the Soulflayer to use the skill list ID that will be available to it in `release`. This branch is _way_ overdue for a update from `release` (switching to it stills need to deal with non-ignored confs). I'll do that merge after this PR is merged into blue-mage, and I'll uncomment Reprobation then.

I'm okay with merging this without Immortal Shield and Immoral Mind being scripted. We can add those later (after some testing on retail for Immortal Mind). Can potentially hold off on a `blue-mage` -> `canary` merge if those two missing skills are a concern for balance/"earn it" reasons.
