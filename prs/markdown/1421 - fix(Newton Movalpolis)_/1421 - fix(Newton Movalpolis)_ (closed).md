_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1421_

----

Each furnace hatch was only tied to its closest gate. This is not how the hatch works and it makes it impossible to traverse Newton Movalpolis to get to the Mine Shaft. Each furnace hatch should toggle all gates. This commit enforces that behavior.

offset is still needed to play the correct event (I think it's a short cutscene of your character toggling the lever) two lines later.

Don't worry about the CI, Ubuntu 18.04 and MariaDB 10.1 are apparently not friends anymore 🤷 

LGTM!
