Can combine these with the random modulo into one:
```lua
if mobID == ID.mob.TEMENOS_N_MOB[1] + (random % 2) then
    -- Chests
end
```

Although, there is a ffxiclopedia and bgwiki conflict:

> [The chest dropper is one of the Goblin Slaughterman in the NW corner OR SE corner. ](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Temenos_-_Northern_Tower)

Think this is same as the Antican.
From wiki:
`Either the Cryptonberry Designator or Cryptonberry Abductor will open the portal. The lone THF is recommended.`
Recommending the THF implies a choice from any of them.

I'm not sure what I did here, but it looks wrong. `random` can be 1-6, but doors won't open if it's 1 or 2. Will fix.

Correction: 1 and 2 is handled by the BRD or WHM that doesn't drop the chests.

I think the issue was I was getting navmesh errors if I don't spawn the pets at the start, and they'll be spawned before they should be (DRG pets) if I don't despawn them.

Usual "this was already here, but...." disclaimer: What happens if a party decides to engage one, hold it, and then kill the linked mob to try to get around the "strength increasing" effect?

(Or a wipe after killing the linked mob.)

We may want to move the "gets stronger" logic to the onDeath of the linked mob.

Since they link by sight you'd be able to pull from behind 1 at a time. I think they all attack at once, but may be wrong.

Same as before regarding strength/weaken and engaged v death, but this time to the players' detriment. ðŸ˜„ 

(In this case, being aggroed by a boss before the last mook is dead, and then the boss not getting weaker until it re-engages.)

I believe it's 1 random Aern in 4 set groups of Aerns.  I currently have it set as the center mob in each of these groups, so does need to be randomized a bit. They also need to have their loot removed from db and manually drop coins based on how many times they RR.

Think this is same as the Antican.
From wiki:
`Either the Cryptonberry Designator or Cryptonberry Abductor will open the portal. The lone THF is recommended.`
Recommending the THF implies a choice from any of them.

I'm not sure what I did here, but it looks wrong. `random` can be 1-6, but doors won't open if it's 1 or 2. Will fix.

Correction: 1 and 2 is handled by the BRD or WHM that doesn't drop the chests.

I think the issue was I was getting navmesh errors if I don't spawn the pets at the start, and they'll be spawned before they should be (DRG pets) if I don't despawn them.

I probably should have asked earlier- and I know this was already here - but can we use standard linking mechanics for these situations?

Usual "this was already here, but...." disclaimer: What happens if a party decides to engage one, hold it, and then kill the linked mob to try to get around the "strength increasing" effect?

(Or a wipe after killing the linked mob.)

We may want to move the "gets stronger" logic to the onDeath of the linked mob.

Since they link by sight you'd be able to pull from behind 1 at a time. I think they all attack at once, but may be wrong.

To show I _have_ been paying attention: These are for the Mook Orc DRG and the Boss Yagudo SMN, right?

Same as before regarding strength/weaken and engaged v death, but this time to the players' detriment. ðŸ˜„ 

(In this case, being aggroed by a boss before the last mook is dead, and then the boss not getting weaker until it re-engages.)

Yeah that sounds better. I think it's supposed to force a textless 2hr animation too, not sure how to do that.

I believe it's 1 random Aern in 4 set groups of Aerns.  I currently have it set as the center mob in each of these groups, so does need to be randomized a bit. They also need to have their loot removed from db and manually drop coins based on how many times they RR.

This was already being done with elemental resistance in the Mystic Avatar script, so I just moved it to the elementals. It sounds like it should be damage taken though not elemental resist.

Probably the element defense mods, which act like damage taken mods of 1 specified element each - the early revisions often mixed these up with resistance rate mods
