If using npcUtil.tradeHas(), which flags matched items to be removed, then use player:confirmTrade() rather than player:tradeComplete().  confirmTrade consumes only the marked items, and returns excess items in the trade window to the player.  tradeComplete removes from player all items put into the trade window.

If all the qms are the same code can make a global for the zone and just have each script pull the data from it.

Do players "share" traps? In that, if Player A baits the trap, if Player B checks later, Player B can get the spawn?

I believe in this case you can push an amend commit that changes it back to the exact original value. These files can be edited manually, but you may need to use an external text editor since Visual Studio is reluctant to let you open/edit project files by hand.

If you're going to retarget the solution, I don't think there's a way to prevent changes to your project file from being potentially included in git changes - it can't be added to `.gitignore` because sometimes the solution _does_ need to change. You can check the file changes before you commit and "revert" any changes that Visual Studio made after a retarget. (Alternatively: update your toolset so you don't need to retarget ðŸ˜‰)

I went ahead and globalized these functions and cleaned up some style stuff. I also did some retail testing and found that only 1 player can trade to each QM, and only that player can check the trap, so I updated to reflect that as well. I'm pretty sure that Ziphius will always spawn from 1 random trap given that it's been baited, so I changed that as well.

Thanks for squaring all that away. Didnt know what was meant by globalize the functions. Glad someone with a lot more knowledge was able to get it sorted and implemented!
