_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 561_

----

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

If I open a WIP PR, maybe it'll shame me into finishing this chunk of work so it can be merged into canary ðŸ‘€ 

UPDATE: I've filled in the missing moves and the bosses are starting to feel a bit more right. They will at least not sit around like potatoes doing 0 damage all the time. 

It looks like some of the animations are missing/wrong (but nothing is borked), so as work item for me later is to get more caps of these fights so I can fix them.

```

After merge someone will have to file an issue so we don't forget that this aspect isn't implemented.

We do have damage type immunities, but those are "set and forget" in nature, and the methods involved with making them temporary would be ugly. Will need dedicated effects for them in the future so limited duration can be baked into the initial call.

was going to approve this but got confused by changing these values to 0 - does that mean no target? should it be 4 for target enemy for these two entries? apologies if i am missing something!

That column corresponds to mob_skill_aoe:
https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/sql/mob_skills.sql#L33

I can't find the enum that describes it, but 0 is single-target:

Actually, does Siren have a spell list?
