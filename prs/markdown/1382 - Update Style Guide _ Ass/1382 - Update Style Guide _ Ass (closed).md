Request:
```cpp
if (stuff)
{
   doMoreStuff():
{
if (stuff)
{
   doMoreStuff():
{
```
vs
```cpp
if (stuff)
{
   doMoreStuff():
{

if (stuff)
{
   doMoreStuff():
{
```
For readability I would like a blank line between conditionals that are not an `else` / `else if` rule written into contributing.md for the C++ part
