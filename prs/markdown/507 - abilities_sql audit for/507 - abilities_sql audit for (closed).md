CE and VE values to reflect retail values

I updated all that i could to known retail values, any that are unknown or need work are noted.

_Still not known values and notes_:

- **Overdrive**:  CE ??? VE ???.

- **Repair**: CE and VE needs to be added to the lua as updateFromCure for the recovery potency.

- **Retrieve**: CE ??? VE ???, probly 0.

- **Deep Breathing**: CE ??? VE ???, probly 0.

- **Role Reversal**: CE ??? VE ???, not sure on this one as it swaps HP and MP but probly dont add CE or VE.

- **Healing Waltz**: CE and VE values should be probly be set in lua per effect removed, left as is for now.

- **Double Shot**: CE and VE should be calculated from dmg delt, reduced this to CE 1 and VE 80.

- **hagakure**: lowered the VE on this as its unkown but as it does not directly affect the mob it feels like it should be 80 rather than 300.

- **Bully**:  VE was too low for an ability against a mob, raised to 300.

- **Maintenance**: CE and VE values should be probly be set in lua per effect removed, left as is for now.

- **Lunge**: CE and VE values need to be calculated based on dmg delt in lua.

- **Vivacious Pulse**: CE and VE needs to be added to the lua as updateFromCure for the recovery potency.

• **Double shot**: although i have no numbers for CE and VE, reading the description and seeing how other damage CE and VE calculations are done i can conclude that this needs the majority of its hate calculated through it DMG delt in the lua and the base should be the same as other abilities that do not directly affect the mob, this could be wrong but it is an educated guess. 

• **Hagakure**: As this  does not directly affect the mob i concluded that the values should be lower, this is an on going trend with other abilites that do not directly affect the mob in any way and again could be wrong.

• **Bully**: Although this is higher now, it does not generate an amazing amount of hate, but it should be higher than it was due to the nature of the ability, again this is just an educated guess due to the trend of other abilities.

• **Stymie**: Again as this  does not directly affect the mob i concluded that the values should be lower, this is an on going trend with other abilites that do not directly affect the mob in any way and again could be wrong.

• **Mikage**: Again as this  does not directly affect the mob i concluded that the values should be lower, this is an on going trend with other abilites that do not directly affect the mob in any way and again could be wrong.

I am open to all opinions and changes relating to the values used and if anyone feels they are incorrect and wants to change any values and has reasons behind them, please feel to comment.

Not really much around for the CE and VE values, although 99% of these are from BG, i found a few disscutions on FFXIAH and google to help cross reference these as much as i could.

[Cumulative Enmity and Volatile Enmity](https://www.bg-wiki.com/index.php?curid=11855)

 - Cumulative Enmity (CE): Diminishes as a player takes damage or is the target of certain offensive actions  
 - Volatile Enmity (VE): Diminishes as time passes.

I'm okay with the increases pending more retail testing. Absent concrete reason to believe the abilities are 0 enmity (ie: a source saying so definitively, not just having blank fields), bringing the self-target abilities from 0 up to the same values as abilities like Convert, Penury, Footwork, Spontaneity, etc doesn't sound too crazy. We can always adjust them _higher_ if there are later sources saying as such.

Nyu and I created a merge conflict for this earlier today. So I did the rebase and force-push to your branch so I can merge! Hope you don't mind~!
