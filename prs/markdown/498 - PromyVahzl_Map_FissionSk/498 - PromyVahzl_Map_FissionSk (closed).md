I wasn't paying attention when this was being talked about in Discord, this doesn't have any far-reaching consequences, does it?

It's redundant because all battlefield mobs already superlink. There are, however, 3 exceptions to that superlink rule and this overrides that exception, so the only thing it's doing is preventing the exceptions. It will also cause problems for Limbus, so the conversation earlier was to burn it.

I left it open for further use. There are un-implemented Gorger type mobs that may have skill sets that are slightly different.

So I know you haven't touched this skill list ID, but looking at it I see Offspring have the same skill list as Gorgers - is this what it's supposed to have?
