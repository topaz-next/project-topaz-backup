_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 699_

----

These are the scripts related to geomancer AoE elemental nukes as of #494.

I have not reviewed them yet.

As @Omnione nor @Lynnea1320 will be the author of this Pull Request - and therefore won't be able to push additional commits - review items will have to be addressed in a future Pull Request.

Please review as if this were a normal Pull Request. We'll compile a list of work items that needs to be done for this branch prior to a merge into canary.

bgwiki spell page lists V0 at 140, but the [magic damage page](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Magic_Damage) lists it at 240.

V0 of 240 probably makes more sense when compared with V and V50~
