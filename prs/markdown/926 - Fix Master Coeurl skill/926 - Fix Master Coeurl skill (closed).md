Currently, master coeurls in Zilart expac are using all of the abilities assigned to CoP coeurls.  

This change will fix the master coeurls in Zitah, Attohwa, Yhoator, and Behemoth's Dominion to use only Blaster and Chaotic Eye as intended.

Thanks to Nireya@GoldSaucer for reporting this issue.
