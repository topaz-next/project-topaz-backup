_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1356_

----

Duration was 60, should be 90 according to all sources.

The `applyPlayerResistance` method in monstertpmoves.lua had its signature updated a long time ago, changing the 5th argument from the spell school to the accuracy bonus. Sleepga was not updated and so was receiving a flat accuracy bonus of tpz.skill.ELEMENTAL_MAGIC (38, I think). I've removed that.

Accordiong to ffxiclopedia, Sleepga was supposed to receive an unknown accuracy bonus based on summoning skill. These generally are some factor of summoning magic skill over cap. I've added that bonus with a factor of 1.0.

`spell_data` is already required by `magic`, no big deal, just reference for next time üëç
