_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1447_

----

For this round, I used the following criteria:

1: Item has a specific desynth recipe and yield listed on its BGWiki page (without a level) AND Item has a synthesis recipe
2: Item was previously updated in level but not activated due to yield mismatch.

In cases where the item is craftable, but the desynth recipe had no level assigned to it, the level was set to match the synthesis level, and a comment was added in case future evidence proves that the level should be different.

In cases where the yield shown on FFXIAH/the current database were similar, but not exact matches, (More HQ result information on the BGWiki page primarily), the BGWiki data was used. This includes previously identified mismatched yields, and they have been activated as well.

Some notes: 
Apparently Desynths aren't a huge priority for the BGWiki contributors, especially smithing, we might have to accept data from FFXIclopedia or another source in order to resolve many of these.

I left comments on several still-disabled recipes that I was unsure about how to proceed.

Let's adjust the HQ1 to Yellow Rock while we're here (Kinkobo).

51 is for the "restoral" to fix a broken rod; the synth recipe from the desynth ingredients  ingredients is 56~

BGWiki is listing an earth crystal for the desynth, but I'm fairly certain we can reasonably ignore what was probably an editor copy-pasting from the synth table, and keep this lightning crystal instead.

BGWiki is claiming 35; Sardonyx is a STAT+1, not a STAT+2 like the Peridot and Sphene Rings before it in this cluster

We can correct the HQ yields while we're here:
```
Pearl,
Pearl,
Mythril Ingot
Mythril Ingot x2
```

BGWiki does say a synth/desynth level of 93 though 😉

End of line comments are fine if there's a space after the `--`.
`-- This is fine`.
`--This upsets SQL.`

Trying to figure out where to go from here, There's a lot of just baseline desynths that are still disabled, but can't be fully justified with only BGWiki and FFXIAH as sources. Do we start accepting FFXIclopedia? If so, do we take it for results, or just levels?

From what I understand, everything craftable should be desynthable at the same level as the craft, so I'll make that the goal of my next PR, but there's not justification for all those recepies on BGWiki, and we already know that FFXIAH doesn't have complete data, so I'll have to do verification from FFXIclopedia or another source.
