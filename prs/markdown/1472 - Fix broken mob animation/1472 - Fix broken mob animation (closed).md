If `ActionType` isn't set, there is an area of empty space left behind. The bitpacking at the end of this packet sees that empty space and thinks "Ohh, free real estate" and puts information in there - resulting in a shift of the rest of the packet - which leads to broken animations.

Thanks to Setzor for the explanation!

I take exception to assigning the action type of [weaponskill start](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/wiki/Action-Category-03) inside a [mobskill interrupt](https://github.com/Windower/Lua/wiki/Action-Category-07) case.

But we apparently use `ACTION_WEAPONSKILL_START` for mobskill starts too, so I'm just going to throw my hands in the air and pretend I didn't see this. ðŸ¤·
