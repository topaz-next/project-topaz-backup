Implements the retrace spell into the game, along with related usable items:
- Scroll of Instant Retrace
- Cobra staff
- Fourth staff
- Ram staff

The staves have separate teleport IDs from Retrace because you can use their teleports after joining a different allied nation.

Retrace was changed from an 8 second cast to a 5 second cast recently according to wiki so I adjusted that.

3.4 isn't actually valid because the function doesn't support floating point values. it will become just 3 at that point. I am aware we have some existing code making the same mistake that has not been corrected yet.

1 second? seems kinda short for that animation. But if you already checked and its retail accurate leave it.

I know the rest of this file sets a bad example, but does anyone have thoughts on this using the tables Nireya is defining above for the teleport destinations, rather than defining the same positions twice?

Nireya: `unpack(<table>)` is a lua method which takes a table and breaks it apart into multiple arguments. The order of both needs to line up - so it's not used too often - but it could theoretically be used in this case.

Slightly fewer lines if you want them:
```lua
if not (target:getCampaignAllegiance() > 0) then
    return 0
else
    return 56

I used Warp II as a reference since this spell also is cast on other people, it appears 4 is more correct though yeah. Wasn't aware of that, thanks.

I re-ordered the tables to line up to allow for this method,  but after taking a look at examples and reading a bunch about it I was still pretty stumped at how `unpack` works exactly.

An easy way to think about `pack` and `unpack` is that they add brackets or remove them.

```lua
some_table = pack(1, 2, 3, 4) -- results in a table of {1, 2, 3, 4}
unpack(some_table) -- results in a return value of 1, 2, 3, 4 as separate arguments
```

Unpack is useful in the sense that lua lets you assign multiple values at once, because functions can return multiple values by default.

```lua
local pos = {123, 456, 789}
x, y, z = unpack(pos)
```
Would result in x being assigned to 123, y to 456, and z to 789

Since you'd be calling setPos directly, you can unpack it in the function call:
```lua
local pos = destinations[[ids.BASTOK_MARKETS_S]]
player:setPos(unpack(pos))
```
Should result in a function call to `setPos` equivalent to:
`player:setPos(-291, -10 , -107, 212, 87)`
