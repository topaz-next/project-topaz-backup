Would be clearer to say "victim" or "target" instead of "mob" here, that's how it's called from `attack.cpp` and `battleutils.cpp` etc.

I know that you can cap skill with decent challenge now, but I don't know the probability.
I would have difficulties trying to find the correct values from retail captures (besides i imagine it depends also on level, so would have to do several captures between 1 to 99...)
So i will just log an issue for the moment
