_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 742_

----

Savagery and enchainment were giving 10 tp bonus instead of 100. meritvalue variable set at int8 caused overflow issues with change, so modified to 16 to accommodate.

Did not note any areas where the overflow change would cause issues.
