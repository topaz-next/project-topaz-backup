<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

**NOT YET SANITY TESTED**

I set up static analysis with Sonar, and started fixing all the things it complained about. Each commit explains what I'm doing.

The biggest thing is in the Packet System:
- `session` was poorly named, and shadowed a global session var -> renamed to `PSession`
- Every packet handler made copies of `CBasicPacket`, which isn't a big deal - `CBasicPacket` is just a bag of pointers, but we still shouldn't be doing that in the hot path ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Swapped it for move semantics gubbins

can we use more than one letter for the exception, so it becomes obvious to newbies what this is? I just don't think "e" will cut it, and that will also stop them from googling what this is.

> `e` is a pretty common variable convention to me, but maybe it's just my Java and Python experience has poisoned me. stuck_out_tongue

knee deep in the venom of experience, the young'uns need time to build up resistance
