```lua
        npcUtil.completeQuest(player, SANDORIA, tpz.quest.id.sandoria.INTRODUCTION_TO_TEAMWORK, {
            item = 13342,
            fame = 80, -- fame defaults to 30 if not set

            var = "introToTmwrk_pass"
        })
```
` npcUtil.completeQuest` will do all of this for you. Also check out our [Lua Style Guide](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/CONTRIBUTING.md). Haven't really dug in to the logic but it looks like it works, though you could condense some other stuff too, like
```lua
if (player:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_M and member:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_M or member:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_F) then
```
could be
```lua
if (player:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_M or player:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_F) and 
    (member:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_M or member:getRace() == tpz.race.HUME_F) then

These can be local vars, no need to set in database as the delete in event finish

Changing to the npcUtil seemed to make my server crash... this is what I have.
```lua
if questIntroToTeamwork == QUEST_ACCEPTED and player:getCharVar("introToTmwrk_pass") == 1 then
                -- check their inventory
                npcUtil.completeQuest(player, SANDORIA, INTRODUCTION_TO_TEAMWORK, {
                  item = {13442},
                  fame = 80,
                  title = tpz.title.THIRDRATE_ORGANIZER,

Sorry, my syntax may have been off. I updated my comment above, should work now. Don't forget to `require("scripts/globals/npc_util")`

If these events are all implemented into the script now, we no longer need the comments describing them as separate lines~! ðŸ˜‰ 

(But do keep the comments describing them when you start them later in the file ðŸ˜„ )

Is there an outgoing event option that the player selects to confirm that they're ready for the check?

We could save a few CPU cycles (and line space) by assigning locals of the player's race (right after the party size requirement succeeds) and the member's race (inside the for loop), and then check those cached values in the if instead of calling `member:getRace()` each time:
```lua
local mRace = member:getRace()
if (pRace == tpz.race.HUME_M or pRace == tpz.race.HUME_F) and (mRace == tpz.race.HUME_M or mRace == tpz.race.HUME_F) then
```

Will probably make Lua unhappy!

Believe it or not, both options are 0. The 'automated message' packet is what differentiates the response.

It won't, but the indentation is off on line 193 which caused some confusion.
