Can we put this up higher near the other content/char based settings (caskets, books, outpost warps) ?

Maybe right beneath outposts before the shop section.

Thoughts on maybe having an enum table for trust spell IDs? We're currently using them for the duplicate trust checks, and they'll be used for the onSpawn messages too.

I worry that a player won't be able to progress in missions involving Kupipi if they flag the trust quest and then don't go out and summon her.

But these NPCs are a nightmare, and doing the event priority "properly" with the current system would make tracking her associated quests/missions more difficult, so I'm willing to overlook this and say the player should just go and summon her real quick.

To mark as a TODO: This event will point in the player in the direction of other nation-based trusts they can find (that the player qualifies for). It will probably need either params or an event update (I captured this with an ancient version of EventView which didn't display updates, so would need to check the PV logs).

All of the first-trust quests name drop the two nearest starter zones, and I think the reminder text also tells you to go there. Also, all of the wikis mention it, but that's not such concrete data. I didn't test on retail to see if it HAS to be those zones, or if summoning anywhere will work.

@ibm2431 wishlist item: Teo wants script hooks _for players_ instead of just mobs. so we can stuff global player related things into player.lua in an appropriately named function. We have no hooks for players right now, just binding for on level up/down, zonage/login, and charCreation.

This here for trusts are better off in the spell script I think, but it reminded me. figured I better say something before I forget.

There a few different texts, depending on who you trade in. I'll take it out for now because they'll require a lot more mapping to get right.

Retail will trip the trust dialog and then you can click her again for mission dialog, or vice versa. I forget which was first (sorry!) but it didn't lock me out entirely. I just had to click her twice.

My comment was originally me asking if that was what they were for, but then thought, "That would be incredibly silly, because the trust ID is one of the params - surely those varying lines are tied to that param! _Obviously_ it's for something else, right?"

Yet here we are. Silly SE.

I realize I originally pointed out `getNation()` when I saw the individual checks before, but a thought just occurred: `getRank` returns the player's current nation by default.

And upon checking, it apparently _can't_ give rank for a specific nation. [It was suggested to be added in the comments, but never was](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/src/map/lua/lua_baseentity.cpp#L6003-L6016).

Now that `lvl` is only being used once (since the ifs were reformed), you can probably just grab the player's level during the `if` üòâ

I did try that, but I wasn't getting the keyItem text:
 `npcUtil.completeQuest(player, BASTOK, tpz.quest.id.bastok.TRUST_BASTOK, { ki = tpz.ki.BASTOK_TRUST_PERMIT, var="BastokFirstTrust"}) `

subid on the item. then one call to get the subid instead of maintaining big old enums in multiple places.

@ibm2431 wishlist item: Teo wants script hooks _for players_ instead of just mobs. so we can stuff global player related things into player.lua in an appropriately named function. We have no hooks for players right now, just binding for on level up/down, zonage/login, and charCreation.

This here for trusts are better off in the spell script I think, but it reminded me. figured I better say something before I forget.

There a few different texts, depending on who you trade in. I'll take it out for now because they'll require a lot more mapping to get right.

Retail will trip the trust dialog and then you can click her again for mission dialog, or vice versa. I forget which was first (sorry!) but it didn't lock me out entirely. I just had to click her twice.

Sounds to me like a job for `localVar`

My comment was originally me asking if that was what they were for, but then thought, "That would be incredibly silly, because the trust ID is one of the params - surely those varying lines are tied to that param! _Obviously_ it's for something else, right?"

Yet here we are. Silly SE.

For npcUtil.completeQuest, field name for KI needs to be `keyItem` for it to work

Maybe set this to 0 until the memories are implemented so people don't get confused~

I realize I originally pointed out `getNation()` when I saw the individual checks before, but a thought just occurred: `getRank` returns the player's current nation by default.

And upon checking, it apparently _can't_ give rank for a specific nation. [It was suggested to be added in the comments, but never was](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/release/src/map/lua/lua_baseentity.cpp#L6003-L6016).

Now that `lvl` is only being used once (since the ifs were reformed), you can probably just grab the player's level during the `if` üòâ
