Useful question!

These behaviours are looked at in order behind the scenes, so if you wanted to weight a certain behaviour to be more important, you would put it higher on the list, or add another copy of it with different parameters. 

In this case, if someone in the party is critically low, Kupipi will try and drop a heal on them above all else. If not, she'll try to wake people up with Cure I, then she'll go to her regular type healing checks of 75% and all the other things in the list.

Or at least outside of the gambit checks which happen on every tick ðŸ˜‰ 

Clarity edit: The resonance check obviously needs to happen on every gambit check, but at the moment the resonance _vector_ is being defined on each gambit tick
