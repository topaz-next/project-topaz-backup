_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 909_

----

This is for old DSP databases for characters that haven't done missions
in a while and thus have a shorter mission log because of newer logs
being added for SoA, mini expansions, etc. This new migration will bring
all characters to the new format before continuing to add the mission
log extra data and converting CoP mission IDs. Also added error checking
for other migrations in case of corrupt data, and improved mission log
extra and CoP missions migrations to be more smart/efficient.
