_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1457_

----

This patch is good to go into release and should be the last of the straight-to-release fixes. Future PRs will have more recordsets and features which may warrant their own branch once again. :)

Some have mentioned they don't mind RoE, but don't want or don't like the CHALLENGE SPLASH SPAM. These people are crazy, but regardless here's a settings flag to ~~turn just those off~~ turn all timed records off.

Do they not want the records _period_, or just the blaring trumpets?

I assume the records themselves too. I didn't think it unreasonable that it be disabled, but I can remove the flag; someone can just edit the timetable to all 0's if they want them off.

Just wanting to make sure the setting does what people _expect_ it to do~!
