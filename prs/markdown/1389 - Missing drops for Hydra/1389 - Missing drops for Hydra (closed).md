Purely a style thing, but using ';' as a delimiter here makes me a little uneasy because it's a valid character for SQL. Can you change this to one of the other styles in the file?
`(Hydra) Hydra Meat  210%`
`Hydra -- Hydra Meat  210%`

[24% is the highest TH0 bucket (Common)](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Treasure_Hunter), they've got nothing to round up to~! ðŸ˜‰

The TH2 data that FFXIDB has is also useful for the torque and axe. They're right around 56%, which is what the TH2 Common bucket _should_ be. So I'm in full agreement that those are Common drops.
