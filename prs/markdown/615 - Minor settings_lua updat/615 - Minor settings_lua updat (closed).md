Hello.

Enabled all expansions by default and turned the CoP areas level cap off to be retail accurate.

Thanks!

can the crafting be increase to the previous default (2.6) as it's difficult to skill up with 1.0? 

I'm not sure if Weapon skill skillup also needs to be reverted back to its previous default (2.5)

I know we are targetting current retail, but with the current settings for skill ups becomes impossible ^^;; (unsure about weaponskill though but for sure for crafting)

how about we fix the crafting to be retail accurate at 1.0 instead. 1.0 is ***supposed to be*** retail, and moving it back to 2.6  just hides the underlying problem. Like being told to clean your room and shoving everything under the bed before mom & dad come back. Nearly every server customizes this  - just change yours.

@kain the monster that lives there is complaining, says to get a storage locker instead of using his home for all your stuff.

If we want 1.0 to be retail, we should in fact change the defaults in map.cpp to 1.0 as well; looks like whoever changed it in the default conf missed changing it there.

The synth utils does need at least a partial rewrite though. Has for some time.
