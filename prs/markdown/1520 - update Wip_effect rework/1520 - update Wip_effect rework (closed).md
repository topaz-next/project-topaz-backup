<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [n/a] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

No new changes in this pr, just updating the branch to get the new element stuff ibm did so I can safely add the missing element damage mods without fear of the element ID being "wrong".

Another PR for those will be along as soon as I finish with them.
