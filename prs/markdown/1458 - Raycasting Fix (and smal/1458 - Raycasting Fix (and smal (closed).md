_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1458_

----

**NOTE:** There is a patch that must be applied to this PR if you're taking it in isolation, otherwise you get strange behaviour (see comments below).
**PATCH:** https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/commit/26263447def756aead19281e19cd5f3757cd467b

Stop players being able to hide off-navmesh close to walls.

This is a further cleaned up and tested version of the code changes in here: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1423
I'm going to dedicate that PR solely to actual navmesh changes.

EDIT: Thanks again to @xenonsmurf for digging into recast/detour and figuring out all of this stuff, and for teaching the community how to deal with navigation and navmeshes üôè 

EDIT2: Added exploit tag, while this isn't directly harmful to a server, it does allow abusers to avoid dangers and 'cheese' certain zones. No bueno.

I have gotten a report that this has created "wallhacking death machines", looking into it right away!
