Not yet tested! But these seem like they'll be useful for any server that wants to downplay the power of trusts, so they aren't so much of a crutch.

> Will gambits adjust for impossible weapon skills if the skill level is no longer sufficient due to setting?

I'm not convinced there is such a thing as impossible for their weaponskills. multiple trusts don't obey the player rules and will use ws they would not have had access to on retail when summoned low lv. Surprised this even got a setting separate from base stats.
