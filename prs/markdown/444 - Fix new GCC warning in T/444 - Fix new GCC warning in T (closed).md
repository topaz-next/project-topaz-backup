<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

**Work:**
In hindsight, I shouldn't have been using `CCharEntity` stuff inside `CBattleEntity`. This moves `ForPartyWithTrusts()` into `CCharEntity` and blocks incorrect usage from the lua side with debug break.

**Tested:**
Summoning trusts, the only current use of this function.
Warning is gone üëç

Instead of debug break, maybe push a nil? Then you can have liberal usage of `for pairs` wherever you want without fear of crashing the server~!

Nevermind me, this is a template and isn't returning a table.
