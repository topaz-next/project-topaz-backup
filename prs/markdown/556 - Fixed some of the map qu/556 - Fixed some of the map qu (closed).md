Does this need to be rebased? I see lots of changes not related to map quests  :crying_cat_face:

Indeed, seems extra commits, as well as map.conf may have been accidentally added. :(

Ugh I thought I slapped a clean Topaz over it but maybe I messed it up like
I usually do.

if you clone a clean topaz locally, you can force push to arbitrary urls and specify what branch. if you force push over the branch on your fork the PR comes from, it will automatically replace the PR content and let you pretend nothing wrong ever happened. I haven't at all done this to hide hundreds of mistake on my part. Or if I didn't you can't prove nuthin! :wink:
