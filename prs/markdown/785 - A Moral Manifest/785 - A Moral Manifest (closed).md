You might want a check to see if these mobs are alive before despawning them to avoid errors.
something like:
```
if not GetMobByID(i):isDead() then
    DespawnMob(i)
end
```

someone else might have a better method to add, this is just a quick example.

I think we are trying to get everyone to start using the **npcUtil.tradeHas** method of checking items now if possible, to avoid issues,
A reveiwer can elaborate more on this if possible, but the function is found in the global npc_util.lua,
you should be able to search other scripts using this style of trading, again i may be incorrect, i am just pointing out potential issues for reviewers to look through, dont feel this is an issue unless others have asked to have this changed.

This is why testing again after you change something is important. If you have difficulty getting it to work when testing, hit folks up for help - discord is usually pretty active with ppl willing to assist

This actually shouldn't be a problem, and if it is we should make the core not let that be a problem. If I tell an entity to despawn that is already in the process of doing so it should just do nothing (as soon as they die they code sends them to the despawn state).


p.s.   
there is(was?) a rare known related bug where if you despawn an entity while it is actively fighting and its melee round completed after the despawn command hits it gets stuck. I dunno if that was ever fixed, but thats also a thing to handle core side outside of this pr if it wasn't
