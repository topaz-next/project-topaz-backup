_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 860_

----

*Script was missing function to set the POS of a GM if the !zone command was used.
*Without the function, GM would be trapped inside the circular counter in the middle of the map.
*Yes, all a GM would need to do is !wallhack or !pos to get themselves untrapped but typing is hard when it's un-necessary.
*POS added is the same as when a player zones into Heaven's Tower from Windurst Walls.

Noticed after the first push that I didn't set the correct Z value, second push corrects that.
