Fixes #667 
Relates to #682 

This PR fixes the remaining issues with quest "Flyers for Regine" and neatens the code.

* When approaching tradable NPCs, you now receive a message "So-and-so looks over curiously for a moment."
* The "looks over curiously" messages are now found by offsets from a base message.
* The after-trading dialog from each NPC is now prefixed with their name.
* Trade progress is now tracked with a single bitmask rather than 15 vars.
* Code for defining approach regions and trading flyers is now contained in scripts/quests/flyers_for_regine

I know this was always here, but do we happen to know if the pre-quest CS only happens once _ever_, or just once per zone?

It might be possible to reduce the number of loops by taking advantage of how every zone always has 5. You'd need a _tiny_ bridge table linking a zone ID to an offset, but once you have it:
```lua
-- pseudo
local zone_offsets = {
  [tpz.zone.PORT_SAN_DORIA] = 0,
  [tpz.zone.NORTHERN_SAN_DORIA] = 1,
}

quests.flyers_for_regine.initZone = function(zone)
local offset = ffr.zoneOffset[zone_id]
for i = offset, offset + 5 do
  local npc = npcData[i]
  registerRegion(npc.region, npc.x)
```

Although it'd only save _just a few_ cycles, so it's up to you.

regionEnter checks could then use the offsets too, so you're only checking up to 5 regions per check, as opposed to potentially up to 15.

I'm working off a video -- no retail access -- so can't answer this off the top of my head.  I added this question to an already-open Flyers for Regine question I have in the FFXICaptures discord.

I'd like to leave this PR as is for now.  However, I'm going to revisit FFR once I have answers to questions in Captures discord.  When I do the next (last?) FFR PR, I'll include this change too.

Sounds good - I guess I jumped the gun when coming up with a target branch name for this. ðŸ˜…
