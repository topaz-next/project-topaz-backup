Should probably check `>= QUEST_ACCEPTED` since this is repeatable.

Does this actually get removed from your completed quests if you start it again?

Change to `getMidnight()` as the charvar then you can get rid of `realday`.

If you use `getMidnight()` as the charvar, you can just do this:
```lua
os.time() < cdate -- need to wait till jp midnight
os.time() >= cdate -- good to complete

This will need to check that AllInTheCards >= QUEST_ACCEPTED for people repeating the quest. Something like:
```lua
elseif AllInTheCards >= QUEST_ACCEPTED then
    if cdate >= os.time() then
        player:startEvent(10111) 
    elseif cdate == 0 then
        player:startEvent(10113)
    elseif cdate < os.time() then
        player:startEvent(10112) 
    end
```
Once a quest is marked as complete it stays that way unless it's manually deleted. Adding the quest again doesn't set it back to accepted. Once you complete the quest, it will always give you cs 10113 and never continue to the stuff past this block. I'm not sure how this quest is supposed to progress, but you will probably need to add a localvar to track whether the player has denied this quest/timer isn't up yet so that they can talk again and get the next quest dialogue.

Remove the "end" right before here and use `elseif` - the only reason to use two separate if/end blocks is if both things can execute, which here that is not the case.

May be some leftover tabs in the file, and it's lining up in your editor because the "indent space" for a tab is set to be equal width to four actual spaces. End result is it looks okay on your screen, but if that tab space amount is different on a different display (ie: here on GitHub) it'll no longer line up.

I think the only other issue I see is there is nothing in onEventFinish that sets `Cardstemp` for this CS, so after they accept the quest but before they complete it, while they're waiting, the other quests aren't accessible.
