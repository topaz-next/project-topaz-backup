_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1439_

----

Continuing the work of #1306, This is the first step of verifying excluded recipes following the synthesis database rewrite. Per [IBM2431's comment](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1306#issuecomment-717001439), I have activated and assigned levels to recepies with the following criteria:

1. Desynth with FFXIAH listing the skill level as 255
2. BGWiki lists a specific level (no approximations or verification needed flags)
3. Recipe and results match

No assumptions were made based on similar recipes (various gem rings and earrings for example), and no other data was considered.

Recipes with a specific BGWiki skill level but a mismatch in yield or recipe had their skill level set, but remained commented out and had comment added at the end of the line.

BGWiki seems confused about HQ yields on their page; I'm fine with these.

[BGWiki is claiming this Scorpion Ring desynth is 60](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Scorpion_Ring). Both [FFXIAH](https://www.ffxiah.com/recipes/555) and BGWiki say the _synth_ is 60.

Hrm. BGWiki is claiming HQ3 of Mythril Ingot x2, while the current quantity came from [FFXIAH claiming Mythril Ingot x3](https://www.ffxiah.com/recipes/423). Dunno how we want to proceed, or if we want to keep excluding the recipe for further verification.

For _yield_ mismatches (_not ingredients_), I'd be okay with going with just BGWiki unless FFXIAH deliberately contradicts.

FFXIAH only recorded what it saw and I don't think it recorded/displays different HQ tiers properly. So if it only saw an [HQ of Bronze Ingot x3](https://www.ffxiah.com/recipes/3199), _I'd_ be okay with [BGWiki's claims that the Bronze Ingot x3 is HQ3, and filling in their claimed HQ1 and HQ2 as appropriate](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Aspis).

But in this case, FFXIAH doesn't _deliberately_ contradict BGWiki by having all tiers filled out with conflicting information. It only has two tiers filled out with mislabeled "tier levels".

I suspect you're going to do another PR for yields, so I won't comment on those further, and just stick to levels for excluded recipes~

(So people who _aren't_ the two of us know what's on BGWiki)
