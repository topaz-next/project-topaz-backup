**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/master/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

This is a clone of my PR for DSP:  https://github.com/DarkstarProject/darkstar/pull/6422

Untested on Manjaro, but I tested it on my Ubuntu 18.04 server and it doesn't break anything. So I'd call it harmless. Configure-and-build from scratch time doesn't appear affected.

I'm not going to go through the effort of setting up a VM with Manjaro and testing the build there. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
