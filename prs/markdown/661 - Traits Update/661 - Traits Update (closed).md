MISC
Divine Benison possibly needs -enmity added to it.
Stalwart Soul values seem questionable.
BGWiki lists NIN having "Stealth II", but I have found no evidence it exists.
Both Wikis declare different levels DRG obtains Dragon Killer. I was unable to verify.
GEO's Elemental Celerity ranks are unverified. It likely caps at tier 3, but 4 is possible.
The levels GEO obtains its various ranks of Elemental Celerity are unknown.
I reordered the Conserve TP traits for readability's sake.
