I'ma  lil too late, but I would have said just give it the name we had already been using and skip the assignment lol. Thanks for making this happen Kreidos.

I considered that. We can still call it either way, just that I was concerned the name wasn't descriptive enough before, and that it didn't follow capitalization standards the way other Luautils functions do. Plus, maybe there'd be momentum behind the existing name. And I questioned changing 13 other files to match. :P I'm indifferent if someone wants to go ahead and change the 13 usages to the new name.

Moved conquest updates over to JST as well, because why not!

Explanation for those not following Discord:
Settings to change when "midnight" occurs can't make in-game things happen _at_ the midnight in an _arbitrary_ timezone - they can only be used to change _your_ midnight _from_ your local midnight _to_ JST, so you can run the server _without having to change your system's timezone_.

Settings to change when in-game midnight "is" (ie: making things happen at midnight in _your local_ timezone) **_can't_** function as desired. **The client is hardcoded to _always expect certain things_ to occur at midnight in JST. No server-side shenanigans can ever change these hardcoded client events and expectations.**

Before anyone brings up any formerly JP midnight things that now aren't: _those_ ones aren't hardcoded into the event in the client like we're talking about, those just used it for a trigger condition. _Those_ can still change. What time is actually JP Midnight cannot, as ibm2431 has stated.

Basically:
- We can make an NPC accept a trade whenever we want. (trigger condition)
- We can't make guilds change their pattern at any time other than true JST. (hardcoded client expectation)

I believe all things should correctly be JST-midnight now, but if things aren't please open issue or discuss on discord; should be very easy to *make* it correct. :)
