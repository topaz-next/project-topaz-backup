_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1120_

----

For the low cost of my sanity and carpal tunnel, I bring you great news!
Previously, only a few categories had records implemented, but I have greatly increased that number.

The following categories have been fully implemented:

Spoils 1
Spoils 2
Combat (Original Areas 1)
Combat (Original Areas 2)
Combat (Original Areas 3)
Combat (Original Areas 4)
Combat (Zilart 1)
Combat (Zilart 2)
Combat (Promathia 1)
Combat (Promathia 2)
Combat (Aht Urhgan)
Combat (Goddess 1)
Combat (Goddess 2)
Combat (Abyssea)

This adds around 196 records to the game, bringing our running total to 256.

Enjoy!

Some build errors snuck into `feature/roe` in the last round, which I ninja-patched a few days ago. Pull `feature/roe` into your branch to get working CI üëç

(if you get another person to sign off on this and update your build I could merge this and ship it into canary today because it's so self-contained)

Yup all looks good. :+1: 

DLC number 2 will be adding more, and I will be parting the records out into their own file for sure. :laughing:

Also @zach2good it looks like this is based on the tip of feature/roe, so not sure what's up with the CI? :shrug:
