change to
    elseif IsMoonFull() then
as
    elseif hour == 6 and GetNPCByID(ID.npc.MOONGATE_OFFSET):untargetable() then
didnt work for some reason even tho it looks legit (i just didnt want to be valid on every single vanaday).

We might be able to set up a timer when we _open_ the door, but it's probably not worth it - setting it to false once a real-life hour isn't expensive (and might actually be cheaper than adding an additional timer).
