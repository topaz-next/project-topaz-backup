Hello.

Added and updated BaseSell prices. Based on findprice's latest database (as of 05.19.2020) plus my day-to-day latest additions. Prices are based on neutral NPCs (no fame or whatever is taken in consideration), which should be the go-to ones from now on to check BaseSell prices (Challoux at Port Jeuno and Caiphimonride at Tavnazian Safehold, for example).

Thanks!
