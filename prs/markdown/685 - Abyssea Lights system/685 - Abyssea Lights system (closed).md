_Thursday Jun 04, 2020 at 19:03:31_
_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 685_

----

This PR will introduce the visitant light system for Abyssea, it will currently do nothing but control the lights that a player receives after killing a mob in an  Abyssea zone, all mobs have been mapped for the lights they should give, and all light values are as retail unless no information could be found, in which case the value will be an estimate based on other mobs of the same family in the same tier.

The lights that drop will be dependent on the way the mob has been killed as per retail.

All information has been collated and checked on multiple sites and also from retail testing. 

I have included GM commands to add lights and reset lights accordingly (!addlights and !resetlights).

special thanks to Lynnea of then Dawnbreak server for the help on this.

It looks like these are only being used in their respective blocks below, can we move these definitions down there so we only load the ones we need?

Should `attacker` be `player`? Also is this one called for each member? Then DropLights adds light for each member as well, so are they getting hit twice? Should this check for `isKiller`?

Will this reset lights if a player logs out then logs back in? Or accepts a tractor? I think light is supposed to persist that, at least logging out, IDK about tractor.

I think you will get a lua "nil index" error if selectedLight is nil (you may want to bomb out separately before line 45)

I would handle this information the way we handle mob 2hrs - input passed to a mixin, rather than trying to name every mob in every abyssea zone in a global table like this.

You lose your single central location, but gain a cleaner more efficient code path.

Not sure, wikia has this line from 2011,
> Built-up lights are only lost when a character leaves Abyssea. Changing to a different enemy target or logging out/disconnecting does not remove lights, nor do they decay over time.

Sounds like we could potentially store them in a hidden status effect and then flag the effect to be silently lost on zonage - like the Prowess buffs.

Speaking of effects, past me likely did the cruor buffs incorrectly even though they work. >.>;;  (used dummy IDs) I should check that soonish

Actually the DEATH listener only has `mob` and `killer` being passed to it, there is no `isKiller`, and `killer`/`player` can be nil.

Accepting Tractor will remove this effect. (Note that instead of taking you to where Tractor was cast upon you, you will instead end up back at the entry encampment of whatever Abyssea area you were in, with your Visitant status, Abyssea Lights, and mob (EXP or Gil) chain all removed as if you had just entered the area again.)

It will reset the lights when they logout then log back in though, which it shouldn't do.

Status effects and char vars are both stored in the db, char vars read the db every time you use them, so if you keep using them then just make sure you're doing it efficiently as you can.

You would likely need a different status effect for each light type. You could theoretically fit 3 light types into 1 char var, if you wanna go into that.

Sorry just wanna reopen this because `isKiller` is still there. I just want to make sure someone doesn't see it and think it can be used, since only the mob and the killing player, if any, are passed to this function.

even if you used every parameter addStatusEffect has I don't think you could cram it all into visitant. so 7 effects or 7 charVars I guess, that you then have to remember to kill anytime player leaves zone in anyway, which makes me think effect route is less effort.

after disscussing this with others, it seems, the charVar method will be best suited for this task, so this should not be an issue now that the lights should be removed like retail, they stay on death, logout, only reset on zone or timeout or any other means of losing the visitant status.

other similar examples using `== nil` and extra parentheses exist in this pr as well. Does not affect functionality, but I thought you'd like to know to save yourself extra typing in the future.

Should `attacker` be `player`? Also is this one called for each member? Then DropLights adds light for each member as well, so are they getting hit twice? Should this check for `isKiller`?

Will this reset lights if a player logs out then logs back in? Or accepts a tractor? I think light is supposed to persist that, at least logging out, IDK about tractor.

I think you will get a lua "nil index" error if selectedLight is nil (you may want to bomb out separately before line 45)

Why chavars when any zoning loses it on retail? setLocalVar() would fit with retail behavior.

I would handle this information the way we handle mob 2hrs - input passed to a mixin, rather than trying to name every mob in every abyssea zone in a global table like this.

You lose your single central location, but gain a cleaner more efficient code path.

Not sure, wikia has this line from 2011,
> Built-up lights are only lost when a character leaves Abyssea. Changing to a different enemy target or logging out/disconnecting does not remove lights, nor do they decay over time.

Sounds like we could potentially store them in a hidden status effect and then flag the effect to be silently lost on zonage - like the Prowess buffs.

Speaking of effects, past me likely did the cruor buffs incorrectly even though they work. >.>;;  (used dummy IDs) I should check that soonish

Actually the DEATH listener only has `mob` and `killer` being passed to it, there is no `isKiller`, and `killer`/`player` can be nil.

Accepting Tractor will remove this effect. (Note that instead of taking you to where Tractor was cast upon you, you will instead end up back at the entry encampment of whatever Abyssea area you were in, with your Visitant status, Abyssea Lights, and mob (EXP or Gil) chain all removed as if you had just entered the area again.)

Status effects and char vars are both stored in the db, char vars read the db every time you use them, so if you keep using them then just make sure you're doing it efficiently as you can.

You would likely need a different status effect for each light type. You could theoretically fit 3 light types into 1 char var, if you wanna go into that.

Sorry just wanna reopen this because `isKiller` is still there. I just want to make sure someone doesn't see it and think it can be used, since only the mob and the killing player, if any, are passed to this function.

even if you used every parameter addStatusEffect has I don't think you could cram it all into visitant. so 7 effects or 7 charVars I guess, that you then have to remember to kill anytime player leaves zone in anyway, which makes me think effect route is less effort.

after disscussing this with others, it seems, the charVar method will be best suited for this task, so this should not be an issue now that the lights should be removed like retail, they stay on death, logout, only reset on zone or timeout or any other means of losing the visitant status.

other similar examples using `== nil` and extra parentheses exist in this pr as well. Does not affect functionality, but I thought you'd like to know to save yourself extra typing in the future.
