Alternate title: Satisfy Teo OCD

Todo: helper/utils function? The other times we check this we're also modifying the number right in the ability check, which we probably shouldn't be doing.. see Violent Flourish for an example.

on one hand, there is probably a tiny performance saving on returning out before hitting another hasStatsusEffect call. On the other hand..Just look at it. It looks like a sin doesn't it? I'm just saying..

I'm having a small argument with myself about this. On one hand - it is optimised and does no additional work than it has to.

On the other hand, it isn't being called _that much_, and we do much more horrifying things per-tick that make this look insignificant (looking at enmity distribution when someone cures... good lord.)

That being said, if you just ramble a couple of lines at me about performance impact (or lack thereof) I'll just merge it üëç

I wasn‚Äôt 100% on this myself figured I‚Äôd ross noodle and see if it sticks. I thing the way it was is technically more performant by an possibly immeasurably small amount. I just hate if/else towers.
