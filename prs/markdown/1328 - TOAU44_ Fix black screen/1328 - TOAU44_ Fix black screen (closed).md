The order of events was wrong, so you ended up getting attacked while you were in CS. This ends up breaking your cs and results in you being trapped in a black screen.

Also discovered that `entityvsetPos()` doesn't correctly accept a table - like it is programmed to do. Gonna make an issue for that. Skirting around that here for now by using the table's members.

Still have the `player:setPos(-444, -4, 420, 127)` down in the eventFinish~

Yeah, things just got confused by the setPos binding being screwwy with the return table from getEntryPos :(
