Hello.

Updated and added some BaseSell prices as well as a lot of model IDs based on Lelia's work (thanks to him). Wasn't able to update things from his latest archive (from today) because he added item mods and such. I don't want to mess up things I'm not familiar with.

Thanks!

Sometimes Travis has issues setting up and authenticating the packages it needs to build, and needs to be kicked. Can usually click the build status and read the output.
