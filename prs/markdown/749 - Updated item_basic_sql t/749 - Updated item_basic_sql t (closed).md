_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 749_

----

(Submitted the update to DSP discord).

Everything is double checked with FFXI AH/FFXIcyclopedia/BGWiki.
I stopped doing price checks after item 4153, so if price checks need done, either I will do it later, or someone else can...
Please note, item_equipment, item_latents, item_mods, and item_weapon will follow in different PR, as well as some scripts for weapons.

Adds some missing items noted in: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/749

Hello, Delaide, thanks for your PR!

Crystals are still stackable by 12 on retail, not 99 (note from our discussion on Discord).
