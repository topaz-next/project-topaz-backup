Not yet tested, will have time at the weekend.

Side note; iterating a mob's enmity container suuuuuucks.
```cpp
            for (auto [idx, entry] : *PMob->PEnmityContainer->GetEnmityList())
            {
                CBattleEntity* PTarget = entry.PEnmityOwner;
```

Wondering if some genericism with var names / loops might result in us being able to combine the logic for the four branches into one, with the if check just determining which list is getting iterated.

I was thinking the same thing, maybe a "generate lists" section, and then "iterate lists" after

Another option is for me to make `EnmityList` iterable, but I'm sure I'll fight `EnmityContainer` and friends another time
