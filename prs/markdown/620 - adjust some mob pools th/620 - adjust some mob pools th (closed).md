I did a search for mob pools with 0 cmbDelay that were attached to mobs with coordinates.  For each, I infilled some fields from wiki and/or similar pools.  Changes include:

| Mob  | Wiki | Changes  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Bravo  | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bravo)  | made SPAWNTYPE_SCRIPTED |
| Ab_xzomit | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ab'xzomit) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay |
| Aestutaur | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Aestutaur) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay, made linking |
| Akrab | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Akrab) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay |
| Arid_Limule | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Arid_Limule) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay, made BLM, assigned spell list |
| Berserker_Demon | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Berserker_Demon) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay |

| Snow_Wight | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Snow_Wight) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay, made aggro. Snow Wights can be WAR or BLM. This pool is for WAR. We will need to determine which Snow Wights are BLM from retail, and create a new group and pool for them in another PR later. |
| Spitting_Spider | [Link](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Spitting_Spider) | infilled cmbSkill and cmbDelay |

should we make him a monk? not sure wiki is always right, but that is indicated. I'm new to reviewing so if there are nuances to mob_pools jobs then just let me know!

should its weapon be 7 for scythe instead? not sure if visual representation always equates to actual weapon though.

it doesn't. mobs don't have equipment, its just part of their model. He'd do a damage type (slashing, piercing, blunt, h2h) in retail but wouldn't have a "scythe" or  any skill with any weapon type. The attack and accuracy get set in mob_family system and the weapon damage rating and delay are formed from the [mobs level](https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/blob/5991d15a9a17549ca7a076b7a4a42ee3a26be262/src/map/utils/mobutils.cpp#L72)+dmgMulti and delay fields here in mob_pools, completely ignoring its weapon type field (which afaik only determines if it double swings or not, and possibly wich dmg type to give it by just assuming all swords are slashing etc.)

Surprised this didnâ€™t happen sooner, even if _Million Fists_  is hilarious (when its not me).
