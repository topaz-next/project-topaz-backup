_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 912_

----

Based off of [this ActionView database](https://github.com/ibm2431/addons/blob/master/capture/data/actionview/category/Mb-TP.lua), which is the combined work of my, aether's, Nyu's, and Wiggo's passive retail data collection thus far.

New SQL file was generated by a small Lua tool that stepped through our current SQL, checked if the AView DB had a record, and then spit out a replacement line if AView's animation ID didn't match our SQL's animation ID.

(Read: Since this was done by a tool, there isn't room for manual data error on my part.)

I then reviewed the diff and dealt with removing commented double entries (ie: Omega's skills) and adjusting the skill lists of Hurkan and Snapweeds to account for the fact that the skill IDs were one off.

mobs soul voice and benediction share an ID?

that's ironic given most mob 2hrs get different IDs while still looking identical in game.

this is (likely) going to need matching lua changes or we'll have mobs looking awfully funny as it means we probably had them reversed in scripts
