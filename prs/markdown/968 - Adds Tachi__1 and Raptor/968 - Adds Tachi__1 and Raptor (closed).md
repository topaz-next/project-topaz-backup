Only concern is that https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Tachi claims its lv31 for the Tachi desynth (though 33 for the craft). Bg-wiki doesn't specify.

I saw that claim, both in ffxiah's message board and bgwiki.... but are we to believe a level 33 synth has a level 31 desynth?  what madness is this?

The most maddening madness, we should probably pick one and leave a comment in the code saying "we saw this, but this is what we chose"
