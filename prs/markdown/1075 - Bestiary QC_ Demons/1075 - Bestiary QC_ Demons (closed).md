Compared our data against retail captures for mob species within the "Demons" category of the bestiary. Used both the wiki, and also cross-referencing the database by familyId, to find as many mobs within each species as I could. Did one species per commit for easier reviewing.

Separated [Shadow Eyes](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Eye) from [Shadoweyes](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shadoweye).
