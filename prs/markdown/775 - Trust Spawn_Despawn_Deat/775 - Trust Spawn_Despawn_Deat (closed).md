_Friday Jun 26, 2020 at 11:25:33_
_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 775_

----

Ended up completing this feature once I tracked down the required packet and the message offsets.

**Done:**
messageCombat and trust messages

Swapping out hardcoded values for spell table entries.

Swap out hard-coded trust ID values for tabled spellID values in these:

Table the system_messages used in trust.lua

Maybe rename getSeekingParty to isSeekingParty

Add timer for last time a player joined a party or when the party was formed, for the last trust error message

<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->

- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

since you renamed the paclket, maybe rename the table to match its new name?

I expect using the term "synergy" will be confusing once we have synergy craft skill work started.

Does this need to be here rather than msg.lua?, im only asking as we usually put these messages in msg.lua and call from that, and it seems that you allready call tpz.msg for messages.

It doesn't _need_ to be here, but this is following the pattern from basic messages since everything has to flow through core to be able to have the right packet sent out

I worry about starting message ID shifting. I don't know the last time it's happened on the low end, but I don't know if this trust global will be on the minds of people running text ID tools should it happen.

Would it be possible to define a very-first-starting-trust message ID in `msg`, and then calculate offsets based on that?
`local message_id = tpz.msg.combat.GLOBAL_TRUST_OFFSET + ((trust_id - x) * 100)`
The global would need to be adjusted if the _size_ of trust message blocks change, but they'd be a little more resistant if SE decides to throw a couple random messages before the trust block.

Variable naming could be a bit clearer - what's being passed in isn't a message ID, but a message offset. Complication in that you're also calculating a _trust_ offset. Maybe `trust_offset` + `message_offset`.

Are we certain the message selected is random? There's no priority system? I've done a lot of partying with ROV versions of The Princesses, and I remember them _always_ commenting about Iroha.

I don't know how far your retail character is, so I'll tag @project-topaz/researcher :
1. Summon Iroha II
2. Summon The Princesses II
3. See if The Princesses ever comment about each other versus Iroha

I don't remember, but are we already blocking party invites to players if trusts are present? (Either a party leader using trusts sending an invite to a free person, or a player-only party sending an invite to someone with trusts out)

Not a requirement for this PR if we're not; just making sure we don't forget any loose threads~

if its a per zone thing (as in, its in the string dats of each zone, even if they all have the same ID now) it should really be in the IDs.lua anyway just for this reason. if its not in the zones dat, we generally won't need to worry about it shifting. (I'm still in favor of offsets where we can, vs enuming all the stuff and things, just FYI))

I most zones we have several IDs that are generally the same in every zone - we still IDs.lua them because they will eventually get shifted,

Not really, on the core end everything is pretty much unlimited and the only blocking happens on the lua side. The way trusts are handled in and around a player/mixed party is all sorts of wrong. That'll have to be a whole research and dev leg on its own before release :(
