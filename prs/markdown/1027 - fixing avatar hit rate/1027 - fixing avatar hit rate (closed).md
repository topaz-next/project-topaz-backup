**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

I admittedly have not tested this as I'm about to head out on vacation. Confident about the formulas and the first hit acc bonus.

RIP this link, only part of it is still available on wayback machine:
https://web.archive.org/web/20180926041335/https://kegsay.livejournal.com/#item3946

Don't know if it's worth keeping any of this information around?

I've also made sure the wayback machine now has the most current version, just in case the original is someday not available.
