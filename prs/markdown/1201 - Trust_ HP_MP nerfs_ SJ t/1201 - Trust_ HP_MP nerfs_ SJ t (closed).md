<!-- place 'x' mark between square [] brackets to affirm: -->
**_I affirm:_**
- [x] that I agree to Project Topaz's [Limited Contributor License Agreement](http://project-topaz.com/blob/release/CONTRIBUTOR_AGREEMENT.md), as written on this date
- [x] that I've _tested my code_ since the last commit in the PR, and will test after any later commits

**Done**
- Dropped the HP/MP base for growth for Trusts, allowed trusts to get MP based off their subjobs.
- Take Trust SJs into account when seeing if they can cast a spell
- Add Trust: Prishe. Luckily, her moves are already programmed as they are used at the end of COP, so just has to assign them.

...she'd not very good.. Oof.

**Not in this PR**
- Getting the cipher
- The cutscenes and associated TrustMemory arguments for when you receive Prishe's cipher.

ugh. I thought this was refactored out. They should be built from mob family system. No wonder you've had issues they are still being built like players and that's never going to align with retail. This was a part of my originally holding back the merge on DSP.

Yeah, this is the _last_ set of tweaks before I rewrite everything properly. I just wanted to bring trusts down to reasonable and non-facerolly levels of hp/mp
