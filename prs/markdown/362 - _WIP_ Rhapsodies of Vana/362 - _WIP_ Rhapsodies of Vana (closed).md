When the set constructor PR gets merged, you'll be able to do some wonderful things:
```lua
tpz.rhapsodies.unavailability =

tpz.rhapsodies.charactersAvailable = function(player)
    local rov_mission = player:getCurrentMission(ROV)
    for _, char in pairs(tpz.rhapsodies.requiredCharacters[rov_mission]) do
        local expansion_mission = player:getCurrentMission(tpz.rhapsodies.expansion[char])
        if tpz.rhapsodies.unavailability[char][expansion_mission] then
            return false
        end
    end
    return true
end
```

And all the individual `characterAvailable` functions can be cut. When you expect a character check for a mission, you just call the the `tpz.rhapsodies.charactersAvailable(player)` function without having to worry about `and`-ing multiple character checks together.

But you'll have to define a character->expansion lookup table.

As a general rule, ROV cutscenes overrule all expansion cutscenes. Unfortunately, I don't have a capture testing the ROV/COP interaction here - in the only video I have this early in ROV, I talked to it twice and got the "million pieces" message, so I must not have flagged Below the Arks yet.

If you trigger the scene with a full inventory, you'll get the full scene, but the mission will not advance because it failed to give you Lion's Cipher. However, unlike other CS events which will play out all over again if you re-trigger the event, the Shattered Telepoint remembers you already viewed the event and just tries to give you the cipher again. When you successfully acquire the Cipher, _then_ you'll advance to the next mission.

You can see this behavior in "Rhapsodies: A Land After Time (1-11) (Full Inventory)".

The behavior has also held true for all other Ciphers ROV has tried to give me when I've remembered to keep full inventory.

So what'll need to be done is something like:
```lua
if npcUtil.giveItem then
    -- advance
else
    player:setCharVar("rhapsodies", 1)
end
```

And then... (next)

..back up in the trigger, check for the same mission and the "saw already" var, and then try giving the item again directly (and advancing mission on success) without replaying the CS.

So while I can't show the ROV/COP interaction for the Shattered Telepoint, I _can_ show definetively that _all_ of _these_ ROV cutscenes take priority over the ZM 2, in that it's possible to reach ROV 2-19 without the door flagging the ZM 2 CS.

See: "Rhapsodies: ROV 2-18 ~ ROV 2-24 ("Lowest", Lunette) + ZM 2 + COP 4-1" at 23m40s.

I accidentally proved it twice; once with the character already on ROV 2-19, and then when I _tried_ to flag the ZM2 CS with the second character, but got two ROV CSes before finally getting the ZM2 CS because _that_ character was on ROV 1-17 (Volto Oscuro).

It's outside the scope of this PR, but for future reference for anyone interested - this holds true until ROV 2-23. At that point, even if you have a ROV CS at the door, it will choose ZM 2 _first_, and then you'll be blocked on ROV 2-23/2-24 until you clear ZM 3. (See 54m of the same video.)

This bonus appears to be a static exp value being added to the base; instead of adding to the exp multiplier down below:

So if I'm reading this right, the ROV KI would only add 30 exp, instead of multiplying by 30%.

the heck is all this?? I was able to tie it all to player and mob in the core the same way bcnm is tied. was much shorter  because I was able to reuse existing code.

(maybe its too early in the morning but I don't follow the purpose of doing all of this lua side)

Remember to use the boolean returned by `npcUtil.giveItem` to make sure a player was able to receive an inventory item before you take items from them and complete a quest~

Mhaura's path needs to be something other than zero, or else the player will be swapping paths if they zone into Selbina~!

And then check for the new Mhaura path variable here

This isn't your fault, but this var is missing a `local`

Be sure that the player got their item before advancing here too

As a general rule, ROV cutscenes overrule all expansion cutscenes. Unfortunately, I don't have a capture testing the ROV/COP interaction here - in the only video I have this early in ROV, I talked to it twice and got the "million pieces" message, so I must not have flagged Below the Arks yet.

You'll need to check for the character's ROV here too, because... (see next)

If you trigger the scene with a full inventory, you'll get the full scene, but the mission will not advance because it failed to give you Lion's Cipher. However, unlike other CS events which will play out all over again if you re-trigger the event, the Shattered Telepoint remembers you already viewed the event and just tries to give you the cipher again. When you successfully acquire the Cipher, _then_ you'll advance to the next mission.

You can see this behavior in "Rhapsodies: A Land After Time (1-11) (Full Inventory)".

The behavior has also held true for all other Ciphers ROV has tried to give me when I've remembered to keep full inventory.

So what'll need to be done is something like:
```lua
if npcUtil.giveItem then
    -- advance
else
    player:setCharVar("rhapsodies", 1)
end
```

And then... (next)

..back up in the trigger, check for the same mission and the "saw already" var, and then try giving the item again directly (and advancing mission on success) without replaying the CS.

So while I can't show the ROV/COP interaction for the Shattered Telepoint, I _can_ show definetively that _all_ of _these_ ROV cutscenes take priority over the ZM 2, in that it's possible to reach ROV 2-19 without the door flagging the ZM 2 CS.

See: "Rhapsodies: ROV 2-18 ~ ROV 2-24 ("Lowest", Lunette) + ZM 2 + COP 4-1" at 23m40s.

I accidentally proved it twice; once with the character already on ROV 2-19, and then when I _tried_ to flag the ZM2 CS with the second character, but got two ROV CSes before finally getting the ZM2 CS because _that_ character was on ROV 1-17 (Volto Oscuro).

It's outside the scope of this PR, but for future reference for anyone interested - this holds true until ROV 2-23. At that point, even if you have a ROV CS at the door, it will choose ZM 2 _first_, and then you'll be blocked on ROV 2-23/2-24 until you clear ZM 3. (See 54m of the same video.)

This bonus appears to be a static exp value being added to the base; instead of adding to the exp multiplier down below:

So if I'm reading this right, the ROV KI would only add 30 exp, instead of multiplying by 30%.

the heck is all this?? I was able to tie it all to player and mob in the core the same way bcnm is tied. was much shorter  because I was able to reuse existing code.

(maybe its too early in the morning but I don't follow the purpose of doing all of this lua side)

```cpp
        auto RoVbonus = 0;
        for (auto i = 2884; i <= 2892; ++i) // RHAPSODY KI are sequential, so start at WHITE and end at OCHRE
        {
            if (hasKeyItem(PChar, i))
            {
                RoVbonus += 30;
```
```cpp
        bonus += (int32)(exp * (PChar->getMod(Mod::EXP_BONUS) + RoVbonus / 100.0f));
```
should fix that I think
