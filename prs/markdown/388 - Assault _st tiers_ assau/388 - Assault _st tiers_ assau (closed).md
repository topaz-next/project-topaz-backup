You could support the ROV KI here:
```
local mustWaitTime = 86400 -- 1 day in seconds
if player:hasKeyItem(tpz.ki.RHAPSODY_IN_AZURE) then mustWaitTime = 600 end -- set to 10 minutes
local diffday =  math.floor((os.time() - lastIDtag)/mustWaitTime)
```

Yes there will be alot of changes to retail today configuration. I wrote this all for in era. I did add 1 settings so for for ENABLE_TOAU_ERA and set it for how many people can enter an assault. Era is 3 to 6. Retail is 1 to 6. But most of these changes will be done once I get it setup and working

2 areas are tested and functioning now, L. Cleansing and Imperial Agent Rescue. Rytaal function, runic portal use, appraisals, points, temp items, 100 points on fail attempts, level capping fights, all restrictions to enter a assault with a setting for ERA or retail entering. Era = 3 to 6 player retail 1 to 6
