-Migrating Database
-========================
-
-This folder contains scripts to migrate your database data to a newer format. 
-For example the spells column in the chars table has been separated into 
-a new table, so a migration script has been created to do this for you.
-
-First you'll need python and mysqldb installed on your computer.
-
-## Setup
-
-## Installing Python
-
-This requires Python 3.4+
-
-For Windows users, download the installation file here https://www.python.org/downloads/
-
-For Ubuntu it's already installed. For *most* distros of GNU/Linux one or more versions of python are likely already installed and you should check your package manager.
-
-
-## Installing MySQLdb
-
-A Mysql driver is required to execute mysql commands. This and any other required dependencies can be installed by running the following from bash or command prompt/powershell:
-
-pip install -r requirements.txt
-
-## Running Migrations
-
-Go into the `topaz/migrations` directory and execute the `migrate.py` file.
-
-From the command line: `python migrate.py`
-
-This will run all out-standing migrations and skip migrations that have already ran. 
-Keep in mind no data is deleted and any unused columns are expected to be cleaned up by yourself.
