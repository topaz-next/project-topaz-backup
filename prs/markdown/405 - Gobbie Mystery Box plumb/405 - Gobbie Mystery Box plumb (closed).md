This is about as far as I can take this, I'm pretty busy at the moment. Hopefully this gives a little boost to whever wants to pick this up üëç

I know the dial variables are currently placeholders - so I'm noting for future development - but we might be able to combine and store all of these into a single bitmask.

Bonus points if you give the `startEvent` csids a variable instead in preparation of globalization~

Fairly certain that `updateEvent` drops `true` values~

MIN instead of MINIMUM is enough to.  I was actually going with `MYSTERY_BOX_MIN_AGE` but I think GOBBIE is better now that I see it.
