 We prefer submitting early and often, over monolithic and once. If you're implementing a complex feature, please try to submit PRs as you get each smaller functional aspect working (use your best judgment on what counts as a useful PR). This way we can help make sure you're on the right track before you sink a lot of time into implementations we might want done in a different way.
 
-Please try to leave your PR alone after submission, unless it's to fix bugs you've noticed, or if we've requested changes. If you're still pushing commits after opening the PR, it makes it hard for reviewers to know when you're "finished" and if it's "safe" to begin their reviews.

+# Workflow Guide
+
+* It is **always** better to come into Discord and ask a question instead of investing a lot of time in work that we're going to ask your to rewrite or split up.
+* Cite your sources for things that aren't obvious. This can be comments in your code, or your commit messages. Pull Request descriptions and comments will get lost over time, information in the repo lasts forever.
+* If you're commiting work on someone else's behalf, use git's `--author` argument so they get the credit they deserve.
+* Make your commit messages meaningful, or amend/rebase once you're ready to push.

+## General code guidlines (all languages):
 
+* Your code should strive to be obvious and readable by the casual observer. You aren't going to be the only person who reads/debugs your code.
+* Unix (LF) line ends, GitHub will tell you if you don't have one by putting a ⛔ symbol at the end of your file.
 * Try not to exceed 120 chars width. Exceptions will occur, but try.
 * 4 space indent (death to tabs)
 * No using tabs for alignment either.
 * Trim trailing whitespace.
 
-### C++
+## C++
 
-* Unix (LF) line ends
-* Braces go on a newline unless it's a lambda or empty ([allman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) style)
-* Space between keyword and parentheses
-* No using tabs for alignment
-* UpperCamelCase for namespaced functions and classes
-* UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for ENUM (exception for enum classes: style as classes)
-* Asterisk goes up against the type, not the value. We want:
-  ```
-  Foo* Bar
-  ```
-  not:
-  ```
-  Foo *Bar
-  ```
-  and *definitely* not:
-  ```
-  Foo * Bar
-  ```
+We keep a `.clang-format` file in the root of the repo, but accept it can be difficult to set up for use on _just your changes_, as opposed to entire files that you're working with that might have legacy styling you don't want to mess with.
 
-### Lua
-
-* Unix (LF) line ends
-* Curly braces go on a newline unless empty, or opening a lambda.
-* Our lua functions are typically lowerCamelCased, with few exceptions (just FYI).
-* No parentheses unless needed to clarify order of operations.
-* No semicolons unless multiple statements on a single line.
-* No excess whitespace inside of parentheses solely for alignment.
-* *When* aligning (not always needed), it is preferred to do so like this:
-  ```lua
-  variable  = thing
-  variable2 = thing2
-  ```
-  not like this:
-  ```lua
-  variable1 = thing1
-   variable = thing
-  ```
-  and definitely not like this:
-  ```lua
-  if  variable == thing  then
-  if variable2 == thing2 then
-  ```
-  
-* Large if statements should be broken up like so:
-  ```lua
-  -- Short
-  if condition then
-    bla
-  end
-
-  -- Long or many multiple conditions:
-  if
-    condition and
-    condition or
-    condition
-  then
-    stuff
-  end
-  ```
+Here are the points from `.clang-format` explained:
+
+`# BasedOnStyle: WebKit`
+
+When in doubt, defaulting to `WebKit style with Allman braces` is _seemingly_ a safe option.
+
+`BreakBeforeBraces: Allman`
+
+Braces should _almost always_ be on a new line. 
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+if (x == 5)
+{
+    function();
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+if (x == 5) {
+    function();
+}
+```
+
+`BreakConstructorInitializers: BeforeComma` & `ConstructorInitializerIndentWidth: 0`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+Constructor(int param0, int param1)
+: member0(param0)
+, member1(param1)
+{
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+Constructor(int param0, int param1)
+    : member0(param0), member1(param1){}
+```
+
+`CompactNamespaces: 'false'`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+namespace Foo
+{
+    namespace Bar
+    {
+    }
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+namespace Foo { namespace Bar {
+}}
+```
+
+`Cpp11BracedListStyle: 'false'`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+std::vector<int> x{ 1, 2, 3, 4 };
+
+// Wrong ❌
+std::vector<int> x{1, 2, 3, 4};
+```
+
+`IndentCaseLabels: 'true'`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+switch(x)
+{
+    case 0:
+    {
+        break;
+    }  
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+switch(x)
+{
+case 0:
+{
+    break;
+}  
+}
+```
+* **Note**: It doesn't matter if your `break;` is inside or outside the body of your case statement - as long as it's there (if you indend it to be).
+
+`IndentWidth: 4`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+if (func())
+{
+    reaction();  
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+if (func())
+{
+  reaction();  
+}
+```
+
+`Language: Cpp`
+
+Yup.
+
+`PointerAlignment: Left`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+void function(CBigType* type);
+void function(CBigType& type);
+
+// Wrong ❌
+void function(CBigType *type);
+void function(CBigType &type);
+
+// Wrong ❌
+void function(CBigType * type);
+void function(CBigType & type);
+```
+
+`SortIncludes: 'true'` & `SortUsingDeclarations: 'true'`
+- Try to keep your `include` and `using` statements organised alphabetically, in logical blocks.
+
+`SpaceBeforeParens: ControlStatements`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+if (true)
+{
+    doThing();
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+if(true)
+{
+    doThing();
+}
+```
+
+`Standard: Cpp11`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+A<A<int>>
+
+// Wrong ❌
+A<A<int> >
+```
+
+`UseTab: Never`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️
+<4 spaces>
+
+// Wrong ❌
+<a tab>
+
+// Wrong ❌
+<a half-tab>
+```
+
+In the future we will also adopt a `.clang-tidy` file to apply additional rules. Until then, the most prominent rule from `clang-tidy` is braces around single-line statements:
+
+`-checks="readability-braces-around-statements"`
+
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+if (x == 5)
+{
+    function();
+}
+
+// Wrong ❌
+if (x == 5)
+    function();
+
+// Wrong ❌
+if (x == 5)
+    function(21);
+else
+{
+    function(42);
+}
+```
+
+### C++ Misc & Naming
+
+`Casting - static_cast over C-Style`
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+uint32 param = static_cast<uint32>(input);
+
+// Wrong ❌
+uint32 param = (uint32)input;
+```
+
+`Lambdas`
+
+Formatting tools have a famously difficult time with lamdas, here is an example lambda. If you're using them (lambdas, or tools), do your best!
+```cpp
+// Correct ✔️ 
+auto isEntityAlive = [&](CBigEntity* entity) -> bool
+{
+    return entity->isAlive;
+};
+
+// Correct ✔️ 
+static_cast<CCharEntity>(PPlayer)->ForParty([&](CBattleEntity* entity)
+{
+    entity->doStuff();
+});
+
+// Wrong ❌
+auto isEntityAlive =
+[&](CBigEntity* entity)
+    {
+        return entity->isAlive;
+    };
+
+// Formatting Emergencies ❓
+// clang-format off
+auto isEntityAlive = [&](CBigEntity* entity) -> bool
+{
+    return entity->isAlive;
+};
+// clang-format on
+```
+
+* The STL is your friend, don't be afraid to use it.
+* Be careful with `auto`, it can mask important type details.
+* Be as `const` as you reasonably can.
+* `UpperCamelCase` for namespaced functions and classes.
+* `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for enums (exception for enum classes: style as classes).
+
+## Lua
+
+A lot of the styling rules from the C++ guide can and should be applied to Lua code. Here are the important points to remember when styling your Lua:
+
+`Local vars are (almost) always preferred`
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+local var = 0
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+var = 0
+```
+
+`Allman Braces`
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+local table =
+{
+    content = 1,
+}
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+local table = {
+    content = 1,
+}
+```
+* **NOTE:** The final entry in a multi-line table should have a comma after it.
+
+`No parentheses unless needed to clarify order of operations`
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+if condition1 == 1 then
+    trigger()
+end
+
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+if condition1 and (condition2 or condition3) then
+    trigger()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if (condition1 == 1) then
+    trigger()
+end
+```
+
+`No semicolons`
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+local x = 42
+trigger(42)
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+local x = 42;
+trigger(42);
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+local x = 42; trigger(42);
+```
+
+`Formatting Conditional Blocks`
+```lua
+-- Short - Correct ✔️
+if condition then
+    bla()
+end
+
+-- Long or many multiple conditions - Correct ✔️
+if
+    condition1 and
+    condition2 or
+    not condition3
+then
+    bla()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if  condition1 then
+    bla()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if condition1 and condition2 and
+    not condition3 then
+    bla()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if condition1 and condition2 and
+    not condition3
+then
+    bla()
+end
+```
+
+`No excess whitespace inside of parentheses or solely for alignment`
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+if condition1 and (condition2 or condition3) then
+    trigger()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if condition1 and ( condition2 or condition3 ) then
+    trigger()
+end
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+if
+      condition1 and 
+    ( condition2 or condition3 )
+then
+    trigger()
+end
+```
+
+`Inline tables`
+
+**THIS IS THE ONE EXCEPTION TO THE GLOBAL NEWLINE-BRACE RULES** 
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+tpz.func({
+  entry = 1,
+  entry = 2,
+})
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+tpz.func(
+    {
+        entry = 1,
+        entry = 2,
+    }
+)
+```
+
+### Lua Misc & Naming
+* Our lua functions are typically lowerCamelCased, with few exceptions.
+* Make sure you check out `scripts/globals/npc_util.lua` for useful tools and helpers.
+* If you're going to cache a long table entry into a var with a shorter name, make sure that name still conveys the original meaning.
+```lua
+-- Correct ✔️ 
+local copCurrentMission = player:getCurrentMission(tpz.mission.log_id.COP)
+local copMissionStatus = player:getCharVar("PromathiaStatus")
+local sandyQuests = tpz.quest.id.sandoria
+
+-- Wrong ❌
+local currentMission = player:getCurrentMission(tpz.mission.log_id.COP)
+local missionStatus = player:getCharVar("PromathiaStatus")
+local quests = tpz.quest.id.sandoria
+```
