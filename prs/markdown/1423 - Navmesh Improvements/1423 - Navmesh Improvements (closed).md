Huge props to @xenonsmurf for doing 99% of the legwork for this, I just asked him nicely to do stuff and then tidied up the code and tested it.

To update your submodule (the navmeshes) run: `git submodule update`

EDIT: Code changes have been moved to here: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/pull/1458
