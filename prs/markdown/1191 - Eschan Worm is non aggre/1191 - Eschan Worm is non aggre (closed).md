_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 1191_

----

Eschan Worm is not aggressive according to [here](https://ffxiclopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Eschan_Worm), [here ](https://www.bg-wiki.com/bg/Escha_-_Zi%27Tah)and [here](https://ffxi.gamerescape.com/wiki/Eschan_Worm). Also according to my memory from when I was on trial about half a year ago. Easy to confirm on retail if anyone is in doubt. Default database would be wrong.
