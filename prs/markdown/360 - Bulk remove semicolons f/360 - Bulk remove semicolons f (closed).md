_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 360_

----

This may not actually be every file, but I did the best I could.

Command applied:
    find . -type f -name "*.lua" | xargs -d '\n' sed -i 's/;//g'

Semicolons are not appropriate in Lua per the style guidelines:

There's so many Lua files, I figured we can do it directory by directory. Otherwise it's ridiculous.

(For example: https://github.com/mrhappyasthma/topaz/commit/7277ac15d61230d0093e8cde29057dbefa00bd69)

And here I was considering doing the same thing and racking up some line diff counts. You beat me to it. ðŸ˜‰

Correct. It was too massive of a change to do in a single PR, so there's plenty of room to help out.

I can progressively send out PRs for this but if anyone wants to help out then even better :)
