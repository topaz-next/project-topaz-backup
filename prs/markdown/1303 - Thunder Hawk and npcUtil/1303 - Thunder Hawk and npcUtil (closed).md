Fixes #1292 

Rather than fixing Thunder Hawk's npcUtil option from **ki** to **keyItem** (See #1292), I decided to go the other way with the fix, and rename the option to **ki** for consistency.  Updated all references in codebase.

Also switched some references to the short-hand **tpz.ki**

I'd really like to see the terms ki and keyItem be interchangeable everywhere. we have a high likelihood of future users using the "wrong" one no matter which we keep, so I'd rather we plan for it than simply swap out. I had thought we already did this for the actual global table, just not for the params we're using in the utils functions 

If the "right" one is nil and the other not, lets just populate/duplicate it over before we do the rest of execution.
