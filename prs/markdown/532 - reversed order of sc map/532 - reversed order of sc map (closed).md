_Originally opened as: project-topaz/topaz - Issue 532_

----

fixes - RR to RR fragmentation instead of induration and any other dual component scs. some were doing level 2s instead of level 1s, etc. 
note: this is a friend's code that he has no interest in PRing or getting credit for so I am doing on his behalf. tested on two machines with various SC including blu spells.
